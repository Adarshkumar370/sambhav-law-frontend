<p><u>PARA 1:</u></p>
<p>Para 1: Kaul, J., in a separate judgment, also joined Chandrachud, J. in castigating <strong>[Case 1]</strong>&rsquo;s judgment as follows: There are two aspects of the opinion of Dr D.Y. Chandrachud, J., one of which is common to the opinion of Rohinton F. Nariman, J., needing specific mention. While considering the evolution of constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy he has referred to the judgment in [<strong>Case 1].</strong> In the challenge laid to [<strong>Section 1] </strong>before the Delhi High Court, one of the grounds of challenge was that the said provision amounted to an infringement of the right to dignity and privacy. The Delhi High Court, inter alia, observed [<strong>Case 2]</strong> that the right to live with dignity and the right to privacy both are recognised as dimensions of <strong>[Article 3] </strong>of the Constitution of India. The view of the High Court, however did not find favour with the Supreme Court and it was observed that only a miniscule fraction of the country's population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders and thus, there cannot be any basis for declaring the section ultra vires of provisions of <strong>[Article 1], [Article 2] and [Article 3]</strong> of the Constitution. The matter did not rest at this, as the issue of privacy and dignity discussed by the High Court was also observed upon. The sexual orientation even within the four walls of the house thus became an aspect of debate. I am in agreement with the view of Dr D.Y. Chandrachud, J., who in his judgment, states that the right to privacy cannot be denied, even if there is a miniscule fraction of the population which is affected. The majoritarian concept does not apply to constitutional rights and the courts are often called up on to take what may be categorised as a non-majoritarian view, in the check and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India.</p>

<p><u>PARA 2:</u></p>
<p>Para 2: The Court remarks that, having read the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of India, I regret my inability to agree with the same. The learned Chief Justice has spoken of various matters which are sub judice in this Court in relation to entry of Muslim women in a dargah/mosque; to Parsi women married to non-Parsis and their entry into a fire temple; and issues relating to female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra community. He then goes on to state, &ldquo;the prospect of the issues arising in those cases being referred to a larger bench cannot be ruled out.&rdquo; The larger bench may then also consider it appropriate to decide all issues including the question as to whether the<strong> [Act 1]</strong> governs the temple in question at all. He then states, &ldquo;whether the aforesaid consideration will require grant of a fresh opportunity to all interested parties may also have to be considered.&rdquo; Hence the conclusion is that the review petitions and the fresh writ petitions may remain pending until determination of the questions indicated above by a larger bench as may be constituted by the Chief Justice of India in any of the aforesaid pending matters.</p>
<p>What this Court has before it is review petitions arising out of this Court&rsquo;s judgment<strong>, [ Case 2]</strong> which was delivered on 28 September, 2018, with regard to the Sabarimala temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa. What a future constitution bench or larger bench, if constituted by the learned Chief Justice of India, may or may not do when considering the other issues pending before this Court is, strictly speaking, not before this Court at all.</p>

<p><u>PARA 3:</u></p>
<p>The legality and validity of the Government Orders dated 07.08.2004 and 22.06.2009 was challenged by the displaced arrack workers. They sought implementation of the Order passed by the Government on 20.02.2002 by which the benefit of rehabilitation was given to all the arrack workers who remained unemployed pursuant to the ban. By a judgment dated 29.05.2015, the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Kerala allowed the Writ Petitions and directed the State Government to implement G.O.(Rt) No.81/2002/TD dated 20.02.2002 within a period of two months from the date of the judgment. The learned Single Judge was of the view that the displaced workmen had a legitimate expectation of continued employment, which they could claim. The justification of the Government that the change of policy was on account of overriding public interest, was not accepted by the learned Single Judge.</p>
<p>In the Appeals preferred by the Appellants, the Division Bench of the High Court observed that the Government Order dated 20.02.2002 created legitimate expectation in the workers that they would be entitled for an appointment, as of right. Any change in policy should have been preceded by a suitable opportunity of hearing being given to the arrack workers. In view of the said findings, the Division Bench held that the implementation of the Government Order dated 07.08.2004 is arbitrary and violative of&nbsp;<strong>[Article 1]</strong>&nbsp;of the Constitution of India (for short &ldquo;the Constitution&rdquo;). As the matter pertained to the loss of employment resulting in deprivation of livelihood of the arrack workers, the High Court was of the opinion that the Government Order dated 07.08.2004 was also violative of&nbsp;Article 21&nbsp;of the Constitution. The Government Order dated 07.08.2004 was only in modification of the earlier Order dated 20.02.2002 and not in supersession, according to the High Court. Apart from providing employment to the dependent sons of the deceased arrack workers, the obligation cast on the Government to provide employment to displaced Abkari workers, by Order dated 20.02.2002, continued to exist. The Division Bench of the High Court referred to the Directive Principles, especially Articles 38 to 43 of the Constitution to hold that the policy decision taken by the Government to provide rehabilitation was for the purpose of achieving social objectives. Concluding that the Government Order dated 07.08.2004 suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and unreasonableness, the Division Bench upheld the judgment of the learned Single Judge by which the displaced arrack workers were directed to be provided employment in the Corporation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>PARA 4:</u></p>
<p>Para 4: In a similar vein, the court in <strong>[Case 1] </strong>again commented on this aspect and said that &ldquo;t(T)he Constitution itself, in no uncertain terms, demands that the State shall strive, incessantly and consistently, to promote fraternity amongst all citizens such that dignity of every citizen is protected, nourished and promoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It was to achieve this ideal of fraternity, that the three provisions- Articles 15, 17 and 24 were engrafted. Though&nbsp;<strong>[Article 1]</strong>&nbsp;proscribes the practice of untouchability and pernicious practices associated with it, the Constitution expected Parliament and the 5 1993 (1) SCR 480 6 2011 (7) SCC 457 legislatures to enact effective measures to root it out, as well as all other direct and indirect, (but virulent nevertheless) forms of caste discrimination. Therefore, in my opinion, fraternity is as important a facet of the promise of our freedoms as personal liberty and equality is. The first attempt by Parliament to achieve that end was the enactment of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955.&nbsp;The Act&nbsp;contained a significant provision that where any of the forbidden practices &ldquo;is committed in relation to a member of a Scheduled Caste&rdquo; the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is proved, that such act was committed on the ground of &ldquo;Untouchability&rdquo;. This implied that the burden of proof lies on the accused and not on the prosecution.&nbsp;<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/3026506/">The Protection of Civil Rights Act</a>, 1955, followed. This too made provision for prescribing &ldquo;punishment for the preaching and practice of - "Untouchability" for the enforcement of any disability arising therefrom&rdquo;. The enforcement of social practices associated with untouchability and disabilities was outlawed and made the subject matter of penalties. After nearly 35 years&rsquo; experience, it was felt that the 1955 Act (which was amended in 1976) did not provide sufficient deterrence to social practices, which continued unabated and in a widespread manner, treating members of the scheduled caste and tribe communities in the most discriminatory manner, in most instances, stigmatizing them in public places, virtually denying them the essential humanity which all members of Society are entitled to.</p>

<p><u>PARA 6:</u></p>
<p>Para 6: In <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, it has been ruled that the judiciary should exercise restraint and ordinarily should not encroach into the legislative domain. In this regard, a reference to a three-Judge Bench decision in <strong>[Case2]</strong> is quite instructive. In the said case, a prayer was made before this Court to issue directions for appropriate amendment in the <strong>[Act 1]</strong>. Repelling the submission, the Court held that it is purely a matter of policy which is for the elected representatives of the people to decide and no directions can be issued by the Court in this regard. The Court further observed that this Court cannot issue directions to the legislature to make any particular kind of enactment. In this context, the Court held that under our constitutional scheme, the Parliament and legislative assemblies exercise sovereign power to enact law and no outside power or authority can issue a direction to enact a particular kind of legislation. While so holding, the Court referred to the decision in Supreme Court Employees <strong>[Case 3] </strong>wherein it was held that no court can direct a legislature to enact a particular law and similarly when an executive authority exercises a legislative power by way of a subordinate legislation pursuant to the delegated authority of a legislature, such executive authority cannot be asked to enact a law which it has been empowered to do under the delegated authority.</p>

<p><u>PARA 7:</u></p>
<p>Para 7: My Lords, I concur in this view of the position of an administrative body to which the decision of a question in dispute between parties has been entrusted. The result of its inquiry must, as I have said, be taken, in the absence of directions in the statute to the contrary, to be intended to be reached by its ordinary procedure. In the case of the Local Government Board, it is not doubtful what this procedure is. The Minister at the head of the Board is directly responsible to Parliament like other Ministers. He is responsible not only for what he himself does but for all that is done in his department. The volume of work entrusted to him is very great and he cannot do the great bulk of it himself. He is expected to obtain his materials vicariously through his officials, and he has discharged his duty if he sees that they obtain these materials for him properly. To try to extend his duty beyond this and to insist that he and other members of the Board should do everything personally would be to impair his efficiency. Unlike a Judge in a Court, he is not only at liberty but is compelled to rely on the assistance of his staff.&rdquo; In view of the above clear statement of the law the objection to the validity of the dismissal on the ground that the delegation of the enquiry amounts to the delegation of the power itself is without any substance and must be rejected.&rdquo; Likewise, in High Court of Judicature at Bombay through its&nbsp;<strong>[Case 1]</strong>, this Court, in dealing with the constitution of various committees for the administration of the High Court, when dealing with question of delegation held:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would thus be settled law that the control of the subordinate judiciary under&nbsp;<strong>[Article 1]</strong>&nbsp;is vested in the High Court. After the appointment of the judicial officers by the Governor, the power to transfer, maintain discipline and keep control over them vests in the High Court. The Chief Justice of the High Court is first among the Judges of the High Court. The action taken is by the High Court and not by the Chief Justice in his individual capacity, nor by the Committee of Judges. For the convenient transaction of administrative business in the Court, the Full Court of the Judges of the High Court generally passes a resolution authorising the Chief Justice to constitute various committees including the committee to deal with disciplinary matters pertaining to the subordinate judiciary or the ministerial staff working therein.&nbsp;<strong>[Article 1]</strong>, therefore, relates to the power of taking a decision by the High Court against a member of the subordinate judiciary.</p>

<p><u>PARA 8:</u></p>
<p>Para 8: The principles laid down in Promod Chandra Deb were affirmed by a seven-judge Bench of this Court in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>. The seven-judge Bench also expressly rejected the contention that grants given by a former sovereign are merely voidable until expressly revoked by the new sovereign. The court held that such grants are not enforceable by the municipal court of the new sovereign unless expressly or impliedly recognised by the new sovereign. These principles have also been affirmed by subsequent benches of this Court in Pema Chibar v Union of India, Union of India v Sudhansu Mazumdar. The evidence and arguments submitted before this Court have canvassed four distinct legal regimes. The legal consequences of actions taken, proprietary rights perfected, or injuries suffered in previous legal regimes can only be enforced by this Court if they received implied or express recognition by subsequent sovereigns. Absent such recognition, the change of sovereignty is an act of State and this Court cannot compel a subsequent sovereign to recognise and remedy historical wrongs. The nature of the ancient underlying structure beneath the disputed property dating back to the twelfth century has been the subject matter of great controversy in the present proceedings. Mr Vaidyanathan contended that the structure represented a Hindu temple. It was urged that the existence of an ancient Hindu temple below the disputed property was evidence that title to the disputed land vested in the plaintiff deities in Suit 5. It was further urged that as the land of a deity is inalienable, the title of the plaintiff deities from the twelfth century continues to be legally enforceable today. For this submission to be accepted, it would need to be demonstrated that every subsequent sovereign to the territory within which the disputed land falls either expressly or impliedly recognised the title of the plaintiff deities in <strong>[Suit 5]</strong>. The burden to establish this would rest firmly on the plaintiffs in <strong>[Suit 5]</strong>.</p>

<p><u>PARA 9:</u></p>
<p>Para 9: Our country made tryst with destiny on the midnight hour of 15th August 1947, shedding the colonial yoke. Despite the pain and turbulence of the partition, the best of the legal and political minds assembled together in the Constituent Assembly to give us one of the most elaborate and modern Constitutions.</p>
<p>One of the bedrocks of the Constitution of India is the separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. It is the function of the Legislature to legislate, of the Executive to implement the legislation, and of the Judiciary to test the constitutional validity of the legislation, if a challenge is so laid.</p>
<p>The Legislature, in its wisdom, enacted the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, which has its share of supporters and opponents. The Legislature performed its task. A section of the society, aggrieved by this legislative amendment, has filed petitions before this Court under <strong>[Article]</strong> of the Constitution of India, assailing the constitutionality and legality of this amendment, which is pending consideration. There is no stay of the legislation for the purpose of record.</p>

<p><u>PARA 10:</u></p>
<p>Para 10: Thus, from the above, it is clear that the factual matrix and the relevant provisions which fell for consideration before this Court in the case of <strong>[case 1]</strong> and which fell for consideration by this Court in the case of <strong>[case 2]</strong> were altogether different. As observed hereinabove, Clause 3 of 1955 Order empowered the Central Government to fix &ldquo;the price or the minimum price&rdquo;. The aforesaid Clause 3 of 1955 Order was under consideration by this Court in the case of <strong>[case 1]</strong>. However, subsequently, 1955 Order has been repealed by 1966 Order and Clause 3 of 1966 Order provides that the Central Government may fix &ldquo;the minimum price&rdquo; of the sugarcane. Therefore, when the legislature consciously deleted the word &ldquo;the price&rdquo; and retained the power with the Central Government to fix &ldquo;the minimum price&rdquo;, some meaning has to be given to such a deletion. The intention of the legislature is also required to be considered when certain words in the provisions of a statute are&nbsp;deleted or added and/or substituted. In the case of <strong>[case 1]</strong>, this Court though specifically observed and held that in the field of sugar and sugarcane, both, the Parliament and the State legislature would have the concurrent Jurisdiction as the same will fall under <strong>[Entry 1]</strong> in the Concurrent List of seventh Schedule. Considering the fact that the State Government did not exercise the power of fixing the price, though the powers were available and the Central Government fixed the price/minimum price which came to be adopted by the State Government, this Court in <strong>[case1]</strong> held that in such a situation there is no conflict and the question of repugnancy does not arise. Therefore, we are of the opinion that as such there is no apparent conflict between the decisions in <strong>[case 1]</strong> and <strong>[case 2]</strong>, which require to be referred to a larger Bench of seven Judges.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>PARA 11</u></p>
<p>Para 11: The object sought to be achieved by the Act is to ensure that Parliamentary institutions, political associations and academic and other voluntary 5&nbsp;<strong>[Case 1]</strong>, (2016) 3 SCC 619 17 | P a g e organisation as well as individuals working in the important areas of national life should function in a manner consistent with the values of a sovereign democratic republic without being influenced by foreign contributions or foreign hospitality. The long title of the Act makes it clear that the regulation of acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution is for the purpose of protecting national interest. Candidates for election and political parties or office bearers of political parties are barred from accepting any foreign contribution. The legislative intent is also to prohibit organisations of a political nature from receiving foreign contributions. It is clear that preventing foreign contribution into the political arena is the object sought to be achieved by the Act. Prevention of foreign contributions routed through voluntary organisations which are not connected to party politics is the reason behind introduction of&nbsp;Section 3&nbsp;(1) and&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1]</strong>&nbsp;of the Act. The Central Government is required to take into account the activities, ideology or the programme of the organisation including the association of the organisation with activities of any political party before declaring an organisation as an organisation of political nature not being a political party. Guidelines that are prescribed by the Rules indicate that only those organisations which are actively involved in politics or associated with political parties can be declared as organisations of a political nature. The question that falls for our consideration is whether the guidelines in Rule 3 suffer from vagueness and ambiguity and whether they can be stated to be conferring uncanalised power on the executive. According to Rule 3 (i) an organisation having avowed political objectives in its memorandum of association or bye laws is an organisation of a political nature. As the intention of the legislature is to prohibit foreign funds in active politics, an Association with avowed political objectives (i.e., to play a role in active politics or party politics) cannot be permitted access to foreign funds. There is no ambiguity in the provision and hence, cannot be termed as vague. Therefore, we find no substance in the contention of the Appellant that Rule 3 (i) is ultra vires the Act.</p>
