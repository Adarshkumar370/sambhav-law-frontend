<p><u>PARA 1:</u></p>
<p>Para 1: Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Amit Desai and Mr Chander Uday Singh are undoubtedly right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy of courts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected. However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge its adjudicatory function at two levels &ndash; first in declining to evaluate prima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, in declining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render a prima facie opinion on the first. The High Court did have the power to protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking<strong> [Article 1</strong>]. Where the High Court has failed to do so, this Court would be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional court if it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interference being met. The doors of this Court cannot be closed to a citizen who is able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the State is being weaponized for using the force of criminal law. Our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defense against the deprivation of the liberty of citizens. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many. We must always be mindful of the deeper systemic implications of our decisions. It would be apposite to extract the observations made, albeit in a dissenting opinion, by one of us (Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J.) in a decision of a three-judge bench in Romila Thapar vs Union of India.</p>

<p><u>PARA 2:</u></p>
<p>Para 2: Thus, the reasoning of the judgments in <strong>[Case 1]</strong> and <strong>[Case 2]</strong> being per incuriam in not noticing Sections 9, 35 and the second part of Section 36 of the <strong>[Act 1]</strong> do not commend themselves to us and do not state the law correctly. The fact that <strong>[Case 1] </strong>&nbsp;been followed in National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. v. Lloyds Insulation India Ltd. not take us any further, as National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. v. Lloyds Insulation India Ltd. in following <strong>[Case 1] </strong>a per incuriam judgement, also does not state the law correctly. Thus, it is clear that the automatic-stay of an award, as laid down by these decisions, is incorrect. The resultant position is that Section 36 - even as originally enacted - is not meant to do away with Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, but is really meant to do away with the two bites at the cherry doctrine in the context of awards made in India, and the fact that enforcement of a final award, when read with Section 35, is to be under the CPC, treating the award as if it were a decree of the court.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>PARA 3:</u></p>
<p>Para 3: We are of the considered opinion that the cap on percentage of reservation as has been laid down by Constitution Bench in <strong>[Case 1]</strong> is with the object of striking a balance between the rights under&nbsp;Article 15(1)&nbsp;and&nbsp;15(4)&nbsp;as well as [Article 1] and [Article 2]. The cap on percentage is to achieve principle of equality and with the object to strike a balance which cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable. Providing reservation for advancement of any socially and educationally backward class in public services is not the only means and method for improving the welfare of backward class. The State ought to bring other measures including providing educational facilities to the members of backward class free of cost giving concession in fee, providing opportunities for skill development to enable the candidates from the backward class to be self-reliant.</p>
<p>There can be no quarrel that society changes, law changes, people changes but that does not mean that something which is good and proven to be beneficial in maintaining equality in the society should also be changed in the name of change alone.</p>

<ol>
<li>State governments have the power to increase reservation beyond the ceiling limit of 50% in extraordinary circumstances justified by&nbsp;quantifiable data.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Justice Gaikwad Commission report was based on scientific and quantifiable data which adequately justified both including Marathas as a socially and educationally backward class as well as the extra-ordinary condition of creating reservations beyond the 50% ceiling limit.</li>
<li>The Act meets the test of reasonable classification under Article 14 of the Constitution as it provides reservation for the newly identified class of Marathas, who have been historically incorrectly denied affirmative action, without unjustly depriving the existing Other Backward Classes.</li>
<li>The 102<sup>nd</sup> Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2018 does not curtail the legislative competency of state legislatures to give effect to Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution through a fair and adequately effective Commission.</li>

<p><u>PARA 5:</u></p>
<p>Para 5: It was contended repeatedly that lack of probity in the conduct of the directors is a sufficient cause to invoke just and equitable clause. Drawing our attention to the landmark decision in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, it was contended that even the profitability of the company has no bearing if just and equitable standard is fulfilled and that the test is not whether an act is lawful or not but whether it is oppressive or not. But all these arguments lose sight of the nature of the company that Tata Sons is. As we have indicated elsewhere, Tata Sons is a principal investment holding Company, of which the majority shareholding is with philanthropic Trusts. The majority shareholders are not individuals or corporate entities having deep pockets into which the dividends find their way if the Company does well and declares dividends. The dividends that the Trusts get are to find their way eventually to the fulfilment of charitable purposes. Therefore, <strong>[Tribunal] </strong>should have raised the most fundamental question whether it would be equitable to wind up the Company and thereby starve to death those charitable Trusts, especially on the basis of un&shy;charitable allegations of oppressive and prejudicial conduct. Therefore, the finding of <strong>[Tribunal] </strong>that the facts otherwise justify the winding up of the Company under the just and equitable clause, is completely flawed.</p>

<p><u>PARA 6:</u></p>
<p>Para 6: While the first question was answered in the negative by both the learned Judges (Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai and Justice Aftab Alam) following the ratio of the law laid down in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, difference of opinion has occurred insofar as second question is concerned. Justice Desai took the view that voice sample can be included in the phrase &ldquo;such other tests&rdquo; appearing in Explanation (a) to Section 53 Cr.P.C. by applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis and, therefore, the Magistrate would have an implied power under Section 53 Cr.P.C. to pass an order permitting taking of voice sample in the aid of criminal investigation. On the other hand, Justice Aftab Alam took the view that compulsion on an accused to give his/her voice sample must be authorized on the basis of a law passed by the Legislature instead of a process of judicial interpretation. In this regard, the learned judge (Aftab Alam, J.) also took note of the amendments in Sections 53, 53A and 311-A of the Cr.P.C. by Act No.25 of 2005 introduced with effect from 23<sup>rd</sup> June, 2006 which amendments did not bring, within the fold of the aforesaid provisions of the Cr.P.C., any power in the trial Court to compel an accused to give sample of his/her voice for the purpose of investigation of a criminal charge. Despite unanimity amongst the learned Judges hearing the appeal on the first question on which the learned counsel for the appellant has also not laid much stress it would be appropriate to make the discussions complete to answer the question on the strength of the test laid down by this Court in <strong>[Case 1].</strong> Speaking on behalf of the majority the then learned Chief Justice B.P. Sinha was of the view that the prohibition contemplated by the constitutional provision contained in <strong>[Article 1]</strong> would come in only in cases of testimony of an accused which are self-incriminatory or of a character which has the tendency of incriminating the accused himself. The issue in the case was with regard to specimen writings taken from the accused for comparison with other writings in order to determine the culpability of the accused and whether such a course of action was prohibited under <strong>[Article 1]</strong> of the Constitution. The following observations of the then Chief Justice B.P. Sinha would be apt for recollection as the same conclusively</p>
<p>determines the first question arising.</p>
<p><em>Source: Excerpt taken from a judgement of three judge bench comprising of Chief Justice R. Gogoi, Justice D. Gupta, Justice S. Khanna</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><u>PARA 7:</u></p>
<p>Para 7: The Court reaffirms that &ldquo;it is a principle of international law . . .that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation&rdquo; and that &ldquo;reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act. The Court considers the appropriate remedy in this case to be effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr. Jadhav. This is consistent with the approach that the Court has taken in cases of violations of <strong>[Article]</strong> of the Convention in <strong>[Case 1]. </strong>It is also in line with what the Applicant asks the Court to adjudge and declare in the present case. In the Court&rsquo;s view, India ultimately requests effective remedies for the breaches of the Convention by Pakistan. The Court notes that Pakistan acknowledges that the appropriate remedy in the present case would be effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>The Court considers that a special emphasis must be placed on the need for the review and reconsideration to be effective. The review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr. Jadhav, in order to be effective, must ensure that full weight is given to the effect of the violation of the rights set forth in <strong>[Article],</strong> paragraph 1, of the Convention and guarantee that the violation and the possible prejudice caused by the violation are fully examined. It presupposes the existence of a procedure which is suitable for this purpose. The Court observes that it is normally the judicial process which is suited to the task of review and reconsideration as in <strong>[Case2]</strong>.</p>

<p><u>PARA 9:</u></p>
<p>Para 9: In <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, it was observed that a plea of partition was required to be substantiated as under law, there is a presumption as to jointness. Even separate possession by co&shy;sharers may not, by itself, lead to a presumption of partition.</p>
<p>In <strong>[Case 2]</strong> and <strong>[Case 3]</strong>, it was observed that prima facie a document expressing the intention to divide brings about a division in status, however, it is open to prove that the document was a sham or a nominal one and was not intended to be acted upon and executed for some ulterior purpose. The relations with the estate is the determining factor in the statement made in the document. The statutory requirement of substituted Section 6(5) is stricter to rule out unjust deprivation to the daughter of the coparcener&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In <strong>[Case 4]</strong>, it was laid down that when a purported petition is proved to be a sham, the effect would be that the family is considered joint.</p>
<p>Earlier, an oral partition was permissible, and at the same time, the burden of proof remained on the person who asserted that there was a partition. It is also settled law that Cesser of Commonality is not conclusive proof of partition, merely by the reason that the members are separated in food and residence for the convenience, and separate residence at different places due to service or otherwise does not show separation. Several acts, though not conclusive proof of partition, may lead to that conclusion in conjunction with various other facts.</p>

<p><u>PARA 10:</u></p>
<p>Para 10: Shri Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the Appellant, in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) NO. 18659 of 2017, has argued that the Speaker in the present case has deliberately refused to decide the disqualification petitions before him. This is evident from the fact that no decision is forthcoming till date on petitions that were filed way back in April, 2017. Further it is clear that notice in the present disqualification petition was issued by the Speaker only on 12.09.2018, long after the petition had been filed, and as correctly stated by the High Court, it cannot be expected that the Speaker will decide these petitions at all time the life of the Assembly of 5 years expires. In these circumstances, he has exhorted us to issue a writ of quo warranto against Respondent No.3 stating that he has usurped a constitutional office, and to declare that he cannot do so. He also argued that though it is correct to state that whether a writ petition can at all be filed against inaction by a Speaker is pending before a Bench of 5 Judges of this Court, yet, it is clear from a reading of paragraph 110 of [<strong>Case1]</strong>, that all that was interdicted by that judgment was the grant of interlocutory stays which would prevent Speaker from making a decision and not the other way around. He also strongly relied upon the observations of this Court in [<strong>Case2] </strong>and exhorted us to uphold the reasoning contained in the impugned judgment and then issue a writ of quo warranto against Respondent No. 3.</p>

<p><u>PARA 11:</u></p>
<p>Para 11: <strong>[Section 1]</strong> was originally in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1861, and was brought into the Evidence Act of 1872. <strong>[Section 1]</strong> states that a confession made to any police officer, whatever his rank, cannot be relied upon against a person accused of any offence. &ldquo;Police officer&rdquo; is not defined in the Evidence Act or in any cognate criminal statute. As to what, therefore, &ldquo;police officer&rdquo; means, has been the subject matter of several decisions of this Court, which will be adverted to later. For the time being, <strong>[Section 1]</strong> is to be viewed in contrast to <strong>[Section 2]</strong>, given the situation in India of the use of torture and third- degree measures. Unlike <strong>[Section 2]</strong>, any confession made to a police officer cannot be used as evidence against a person accused of an offence, the voluntariness or otherwise of the confession being irrelevant &ndash; it is conclusively presumed by the legislature that all such confessions made to police officers are tainted with the vice of coercion.</p>
<p>In <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, the Court held: &ldquo;<strong>[Section 1]</strong> provides: &ldquo;No confession made to a police officer, shall be proved as against a person accused of an offence&rdquo;. The terms of <strong>[Section 1]</strong> are imperative. A confession made to a police officer under any circumstances is not admissible in evidence against the accused. It covers a confession made when he was free and not in police custody, as also a confession made before any investigation has begun. The expression &ldquo;accused of any offence&rdquo; covers a person accused of an offence at the trial whether or not he was accused of the offence when he made the confession.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>PARA 12:</u></p>
<p>Para 12: The ascertainment of the nature of legal possession is, in fact, indispensable in every department of law. It is as essential to the determination of international controversies arising out of the settlement of new countries, or to the conviction of a prisoner for larceny, as it is to the selection of the plaintiff in an action of trover or trespass.</p>
<p>In <strong>[Case]</strong>, it was held that a beneficiary who murders the testator was denied a right to the property bequeathed to him, holding that "no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime." The Court of Appeals made the well-known statement, which is particularly applicable here: "It is a familiar canon of construction that a thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter; and a thing which is within the letter of the statute is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of the makers. They also said that one who murdered his ancestor in order to come into possession of his property should not be permitted to take the property.</p>
<p>According to <strong>[Section]</strong>, whenever a person who is in possession of a thing is sued or alleged of not being the owner of that thing, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is upon the person who files the suit or makes such an allegation or assertion in the first place. Possession is also said to be one of the essential requirements for the acquisition of ownership. Moreover, one of the most common methods of transferring ownership is by transfer of possession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q1. Which of the following Case has been referred here as [Case] which was an example of the judiciary using the "social purpose" rule of statutory construction, the process of interpreting and applying legislation?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Gallimore v. Washington</li>
<li>Riggs v. Palmer</li>
<li>Singh v. Napolitano</li>
<li>Enron Nigeria Power Holding, Ltd. v. Fed. Republic of Nigeria</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q2."No one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or to take of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own iniquity or to acquire property by his own crime." This was cited in which famous case?</strong></p>

<li>Gallimore v. Washington</li>
<li>Riggs v. Palmer</li>
<li>Singh v. Napolitano</li>
<li>Enron Nigeria Power Holding, Ltd. v. Fed. Republic of Nigeria</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q3. Ronald Dworkin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Original Problem&rsquo;, based on Riggs v. Palmer, 115 NY 506, is used to illustrate the principle that Law is not merely a system of Rules but there are also &lsquo;principles, policies and other sort of standards&rsquo; that govern the legal system. What was the case scenario in Riggs v. Palmer?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The judge trying the case was himself a witness&nbsp;</li>
<li>A man sued his father who struck him in self defense when the former attempted to kill him&nbsp;</li>
<li>A defamation suit was filed by a man who knew the aspersions against him were true&nbsp;</li>
<li>A man sought to sell the property of the person he killed</li>

<li>Article 65 of the Limitation Act</li>
<li>Section 113 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872</li>
<li>Article 69 of the Limitation Act</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q5. Assertion(A)</strong></p>
<p>Ownership subject to condition subsequent is vested ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Reason(R)</strong></p>
<p>Possession and ownership do not differ in their mode of acquisition.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A</li>
<li>A is false but R is true</li>
<li>Both A and R are true but R is NOT the correct explanation of A</li>
<li>A is true but R is false</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q6. Possession is prima facie evidence of title of ownership in which case?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In all cases possession leads to ownership.</li>
<li>Transfer of possession is not a mode of transferring ownership.</li>
<li>Long possession does not confer tittle to the property, which originally belonged to government.</li>
<li>Long adverse possession confers tittle even to a property, which originally belonged to another.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q7. The right of the creditor to recover the amount due to him. He owns such a right but does not possess it since once he successfully exercises his right to recover the debt, it ceases to exist. This was seen in which Case?</strong></p>
