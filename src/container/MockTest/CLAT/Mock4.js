        <u>PARA 1:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 1: The consistent view taken by this Court that the exercise of
        power of judicial review of the decision taken by His Excellency the
        President of India in mercy petition is very limited. In{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, this Court held thus:&nbsp; The position,
        therefore, is undeniable that judicial review of the order of the
        President or the Governor under Article 72 or Article 161, as the case
        may be, is available and their orders can be impugned on the following
        grounds: (a) that the order has been passed without application of mind;
        (b) that the order is mala fide; (c) that the order has been passed on
        extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (d) that relevant
        materials have been kept out of consideration; (e) that the order
        suffers from arbitrariness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two important aspects were also highlighted by learned amicus curiae;
        one relating to the desirability of indicating reasons in the order
        granting pardon/remission while the other was an equally more important
        question relating to power to withdraw the order of granting
        pardon/remission, if subsequently, materials are placed to show that
        certain relevant materials were not considered or certain materials of
        extensive value were kept out of consideration. According to learned
        amicus curiae, reasons are to be indicated, in the absence of which the
        exercise of judicial review will be affected.&rdquo; The decision in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1] </strong>was followed in <strong>[Case 2]</strong>

        <u>PARA 2:</u>

      <p>
        Para 2: Ld. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that if the Appellant is
        a registered Trade union under sub-section (8) of Section 10 of the
        Trade Union Act, 1926 and under section 15 of the Trade Union Act, the
        General Fund can be used by the Appellant for prosecution or defence of
        any legal proceeding. It was further contended that the Appellant falls
        within the meaning of 'operational creditors' under{" "}
        <strong>[Section 1]</strong> since the 'corporate debtor' owed
        operational debt to its workmen and employees in respect of services,
        including employment, as per <strong>[Section 1].</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;It was also contended that the Trade union is a 'person' defined
        under Section 3, sub-section (23) (g) of the Trade Union Act and from
        collective reading of Section 3 (2 3) (g) of the Trade Union Act with{" "}
        <strong>[Section 1],</strong> it is clear that the trade union being a
        person' the petition under Section 9 of the I&amp;B Code is
        maintainable. Reliance was placed on decisions of High Courts which
        relates to Trade Union Act, however, according to us they are not
        applicable to the provisions of the I&amp;B Code. Ld. Counsel appearing
        on behalf of the Respondent/'corporate debtor' submitted that the
        application under Section 9 of the I&amp;B Code is not maintainable as
        no 'operational debt' is owed by the corporate debtors to the
        Appellant/Trade Union under sub-section (2) of Section. Further,
        according to Respondent, the Appellant/Trade Union does not fulfil the
        criteria under <strong>[Section 1]</strong> to come within in the
        meaning of 'operational creditor'. Furthermore,
        <strong> [Section 1]</strong> is read with Form 5 of Insolvency &amp;
        Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority), 2016 (hereinafter
        referred to Adjudicating Authority Rules), it is clear that application
        can only be filed by 'operational creditor' i.e., an individual workman
        himself or person specifically authorized to act on behalf of the
        workman. As the Appellant is a Trade Union, it lacks authority to issue
        demand notice/file an insolvency application against the answering
        Respondent.

        Para 4: The judgment in <strong>[Case 1] </strong>was referred to a
        larger Bench for re-consideration in view of later rulings, notably{" "}
        <strong>[Case 2] </strong>which had called for a review with respect to
        functioning of tribunals.&nbsp; In <strong>[Case 3]</strong> Court held
        that the power of judicial review vested in the High Courts and this
        Court under Articles 226 and 227, and 32 is a part of the basic
        structure of the Constitution.&nbsp; Therefore, the Court held that the
        Tribunals cannot act as substitutes of the High Courts and this Court,
        and that their functioning is only supplementary and that all decisions
        of administrative Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a
        Division Bench of the respective High Courts.&nbsp; Addressing the issue
        of the dependence of tribunals on the Executive for administrative
        requirements, a recommendation was made for creation of a single
        umbrella organization which will be an independent supervisory body to
        oversee the working of the Tribunals.&nbsp; This Court was also of the
        opinion that the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India should
        be the nodal Ministry. Part I-B and Part I-C were inserted in the{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1]</strong> providing for the constitution of the National
        Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate
        Tribunal (NCLAT).&nbsp;

        <u>PARA 5:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 5: Indeed, in <strong>[Case 1],</strong> this Court after referring
        to a number of authorities including certain recent High Court judgments
        held as under: &ldquo;The correct law of talaq as ordained by the Holy
        Quran is that talaq must be for a reasonable cause and be preceded by
        attempts at reconciliation between the husband and the wife by two
        arbiters &mdash; one from the wife&rsquo;s family and the other from the
        husband&rsquo;s; if the attempts fail, talaq may be affected. In Rukia
        Khatun case the Division Bench stated that the correct law of talaq, as
        ordained by the Holy Quran, is: (i) that &ldquo;talaq&rdquo; must be for
        a reasonable cause; and (ii) that it must be preceded by an attempt of
        reconciliation between the husband and the wife by two arbiters, one
        chosen by the wife from her family and the other by the husband from
        his. If their attempts fail, &ldquo;talaq&rdquo; may be affected. The
        Division Bench expressly recorded its dissent from the Calcutta and
        Bombay views which, in their opinion, did not lay down the correct law.
        14. We are in respectful agreement with the abovesaid observations made
        by the learned Judges of the High Courts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        . Given the fact that Triple Talaq is instant and irrevocable, it is
        obvious that any attempt at reconciliation between the husband and wife
        by two arbiters from their families, which is essential to save the
        marital tie, cannot ever take place. Also, as understood by the Privy
        Council in <strong>[Case 2],</strong> such Triple Talaq is valid even if
        it is not for any reasonable cause, which view of the law no longer
        holds good after <strong>[Case 1],.</strong> This being the case, it is
        clear that this form of Talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that
        the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim
        man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it.

      <p>
        Para 6: It is then stated in the affidavit that the further
        investigation unraveled that the five persons who came to be arrested on
        28th August, 2018 were also involved in the criminal conspiracy and
        their role was not merely peripheral in nature. Based upon the
        incriminating material, they were arrested from the residential or work
        places under similar fashion in the presence of independent panchas who
        were Government Officers. It is also stated that one of them, namely,
        Vernon Gonsalves has been convicted by the Special Court, Nagpur for
        offences under the <strong>[ACT].</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The sum and substance of the reply affidavit is that sufficient material
        has become available during the investigation, which is still in
        progress, to indicate the complicity of the concerned accused who have
        been arrested including the five named persons in respect of whom the
        present writ petition has been filed by third parties. They are arrested
        not because of their political activities but for their involvement in
        the planning and execution of offences to destabilize the society and
        their association with the banned organization Their involvement is
        noticed in selecting and encouraging cadres in the banned organizations
        to go underground in &lsquo;struggle area', mobilizing and distributing
        money, facilitating selection and purchase of arms, deciding the rates
        of such arms and suggesting the routes and ways of smuggling such arms
        into India for its onward distribution amongst the cadres. Some of them
        have suggested training and laying booby traps and directional mines.
        Their involvement is also for providing strategic inputs in furtherance
        of the objective of armed rebellion, on lines of strategic documents of
        the banned terrorist organization. It is stated that all the material
        collected during the investigation will be eventually placed on record
        of the jurisdictional Court along with the police report to be filed in
        due course. Further, the question of showing that material to anyone
        much less accused, would defeat the investigation in progress and that
        is not the requirement of law. The affidavit also emphasizes that house
        arrest of the concerned accused merely restricts physical movement but
        there is no way of ensuring that these persons would not indulge in
        destruction of evidence and ale other potential accused while sitting at
        home. As a matter of fact, their custodial interrogation may become
        necessary during further investigation and for which reason the
        Investigating Agency be granted liberty to take them in police custody
        in accordance with law.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Court should be loath to entertain the writ petition of this
          nature when the investigation of a serious crime is in progress as per
          the statutory provisions and the material gathered during the
          investigation justifies the arrest of the concerned accused.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Court may look at the documents already gathered during the
          investigation to satisfy its conscience as to whether the arrest of
          concerned accused was justified or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          This case is not about ordinary criminal jurisprudence but of
          actualization of constitutional values and to expose the unjustified
          incarceration of innocents who happen to be human rights activists.
          They submit that the liberty and dignity of the accused persons must
          be preserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even though the Court may have jurisdiction to examine all aspects of
          the matter, considering the fact that the investigation is at a
          nascent stage and is being done by senior police officials under the
          supervision of their superior officers up to the level of Commissioner
          of Police, it is not a case for grant of reliefs as prayed.

        <u>PARA 7:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 7: It is submitted that the <strong>[Act 1]</strong> had been
        enacted to remove the disparity of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
        Tribes who remain vulnerable and denied their civil rights. The
        Statement of Objects and Reasons of the <strong>[Act 1]</strong>, for
        which it had been enacted is as:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        "Despite various measures to improve the socio&shy;economic conditions
        of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain
        vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights. They are subjected
        to various offences, indignities, humiliations, and harassment. They
        have, in several brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and
        property. Serious crimes are committed against them for various
        historical, social, and economic reasons.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        When they assert their rights and resist practices of untouchability
        against them or demand statutory minimum wages or refuse to do any
        bonded and forced labour, the vested interests try to cow them down and
        terrorise them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;When the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes try to preserve
        their self-respect or honour of their women, they become irritants for
        the dominant and the mighty. Occupation and cultivation of even the
        Government allotted land by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is
        resented and more often these people become victims of attacks by the
        vested interests. Of late, there has been an increase in the disturbing
        trend of the commission of certain atrocities like making the Scheduled
        Caste persons ear inedible substances, like human excreta and attacks on
        and mass killings of helpless Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
        and rape of women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
        Tribes. Under the circumstances, the existing laws like the Protection
        of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the normal provisions of the Indian Penal
        Code have been found to be inadequate to check these crimes. A special
        legislation to check and deter crimes against them committed by
        non-scheduled Castes and non-scheduled Tribes has, therefore, become
        necessary.

      <p>
        Para 8: The omission in the appeal to make any attempt to sustain the
        circular dated 14 May 2002 with reference to the provisions of&nbsp;
        <strong>[Section 1] </strong>of the Environment Protection Act 1986 is
        significant. For an action of the Central government to be treated as a
        measure referable to&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1] </strong>it must satisfy
        the statutory requirement of being necessary or expedient &ldquo;for the
        purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and
        preventing,&nbsp;controlling and abating environment pollution&rdquo;.
        The circular dated 14 May 2002 in fact does quite the contrary. It
        purported to allow an extension of time for industrial units to comply
        with the requirement of an EC. The EIA notification dated 27 January
        1994 mandated that an EC has to be obtained before embarking on a new
        project or expanding or modernising an existing one. The EIA
        notification of 1994 has been issued under the provisions of
        the&nbsp;Environment Protection Act&nbsp;1986 and the Environment
        Protection Rules 1986, with the object of imposing restrictions and
        prohibitions on setting up of new projects or expansion or modernisation
        of existing project. The measures are based on the precautionary
        principle and aim to protect the interests of the environment. The
        circular dated 14 May 2002 allowed defaulting industrial units who had
        commenced activities without an EC to cure the default by an ex post
        facto clearance. Being an administrative decision, it is beyond the
        scope of&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1] </strong>and cannot be said to be a
        measure for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the
        environment. The circular notes that there were defaulting units which
        had failed to comply with the requirement of obtaining an EC as
        mandated. The circular provided for an extension of time and
        inexplicably introduced the notion of an ex post facto clearance. In
        effect, it impacted the obligation of the industrial units to be in
        compliance with the law. The concept of ex post facto clearance is
        fundamentally at odds with the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994.
        The EIA notification of 1994 contained a stipulation that any expansion
        or modernisation of an activity or setting up of a new project listed in
        Schedule &ndash; I &ldquo;shall not be undertaken in any part of India
        unless it has been accorded environmental clearance&rdquo;. The language
        of the notification is as clear as it can be&nbsp;to indicate that the
        requirement is of a prior EC. A mandatory provision requires complete
        compliance. The words &ldquo;shall not be undertaken&rdquo; read in
        conjunction with the expression &ldquo;unless&rdquo; can only have one
        meaning: before undertaking a new project or expanding or modernising an
        existing one, an EC must be obtained. When the EIA notification of 1994
        mandates a prior EC, it proscribes a post activity approval or an ex
        post facto permission. What is sought to be achieved by the
        administrative circular dated 14 May 2002 is contrary to the statutory
        notification dated 27 January 1994. The circular dated 14 May 2002 does
        not stipulate how the detrimental effects on the environment would be
        taken care of if the project proponent is granted an ex post facto EC.
        The EIA notification of 1994 mandates a prior environmental clearance.
        The circular substantially amends or alters the application of the EIA
        notification of 1994. The mandate of not commencing a new project or
        expanding or modernising an existing one unless an environmental
        clearance has been obtained stands diluted and is rendered ineffective
        by the issuance of the administrative circular dated 14 May 2002. This
        discussion leads us to the conclusion that the administrative circular
        is not a measure protected by&nbsp;Section 3. Hence there was no
        jurisdictional bar on the NGT to enquire into its legitimacy or vires.
        Moreover, the administrative circular is contrary to the EIA
        Notification 1994 which has a statutory character. The circular is
        unsustainable in law.

          From the very beginning of the law/ act it was bad. Such a term is
          used in reference to the law, agreements, a deed executed between
          parties, marriage, etc. If something is said to be void ab initio, the
          thing was never created or void to begin with.

          It states that a person can neither be punished for any offence which
          was at the time of commission not charged as an offence nor be
          subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been
          inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the
          offence.

          This rule operates in a limited class of actions ex delicto such as
          actions for damages for defamation, assault, or other personal
          injuries not causing the death of the party, and in other actions
          where after the death of the party the relief granted could not be

      <p>
        Para 9: This contempt petition raises grave issues regarding the
        criminalisation of politics in India and brings to our attention a
        disregard of the directions of a Constitution Bench of this Court
        in&nbsp;<strong>[Case 1].</strong> In this judgment, this Court was
        cognisant of the increasing criminalisation of politics in India and the
        lack of information about such criminalisation amongst the citizenry. In
        order to remedy this information gap, this Court issued the following
        directions:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Keeping the aforesaid in view, we think it appropriate to issue
        the following directions which are in accord with the decisions of this
        Court:
      </p>
      <p>
        Each contesting candidate shall fill up the form as provided by the
        Election Commission and the form must contain all the particulars as
        required therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        It shall state, in bold letters, with regard to the criminal cases
        pending against the candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a candidate is contesting an election on the ticket of a particular
        party, he/she is required to inform the party about the criminal cases
        pending against him/her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The political party concerned shall be obligated to put up on its
        website the aforesaid information pertaining to candidates having
        criminal antecedents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The candidate as well as the political party concerned shall issue a
        declaration in the widely circulated newspapers in the locality about
        the antecedents of the candidate and also give wide publicity in the
        electronic media. When we say wide publicity, we mean that the same
        shall be done at least thrice after filing of the nomination
        papers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;On a perusal of the documents placed on record and after
        submissions of counsel, it appears that over the last four general
        elections, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of
        criminals in politics. In 2004, 24% of the Members of Parliament had
        criminal cases pending against them; in 2009, that went up to 30%; in
        2014 to 34%; and in 2019 as many as 43% of MPs had criminal cases
        pending against them.

        <u>PARA 10:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 10: The petitioners and interventionists, claiming to be public
        spirited persons, have sought a declaration that Supreme Court case
        proceedings of &ldquo;constitutional importance having an impact on the
        public at large or a large number of people&rdquo; should be live
        streamed in a manner that is easily accessible for public viewing.
        Further direction is sought to frame guidelines to enable the
        determination of exceptional cases that qualify for live streaming and
        to place those guidelines before the Full Court of this Court. To
        buttress these prayers, reliance has been placed on the dictum of a
        nine-Judge Bench of this Court in <strong>[Case 1].,</strong>1 which has
        had an occasion to inter alia consider the arguments of journalists that
        they had a fundamental right to carry on their occupation
        under&nbsp;Article 19(1)(g)&nbsp;of the Constitution; that they also had
        a right to attend the proceedings in court under&nbsp;
        <strong>[Article 1]</strong>&nbsp;and that their right 1 (1966) 3 SCR
        744&nbsp;to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under&nbsp;
        <strong>[Article 2]</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;included their right to publish
        a faithful report of the proceedings which they had witnessed and heard
        in Court as journalists. The Court whilst considering the said argument
        went on to emphasise about the efficacy of open trials for upholding the
        legitimacy and effectiveness of the Courts and for enhancement of public
        confidence and support. It would be apposite to reproduce the relevant
        extract from the said decision propounding about the efficacy of hearing
        of cases in open courts, in the following words:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well-settled that in general, all cases brought before the
        Courts, whether civil, criminal, or others, must be heard in open Court.
        Public trial in open court is undoubtedly essential for the healthy,
        objective and fair administration of justice. Trial held subject to the
        public scrutiny and gaze naturally acts as a check against judicial
        caprice or vagaries, and serves as a powerful instrument for creating
        confidence of the public in the fairness, objectivity, and impartiality
        of the administration of justice. Public confidence in the
        administration of justice is of such great significance that there can
        be no two opinions on the broad proposition that in discharging their
        functions as judicial Tribunals, courts must generally hear causes in
        open and must permit the public admission to the court room.

        Para 11: &ldquo;It was held that, Standard Chartered Bank was classified
        as a secured financial creditor of the corporate debtor by the
        resolution professional. On 04.10.2018, this Court declared both
        ArcelorMittal and Numetal ineligible by virtue of their resolution plans
        being hit by Section 29-A of the Code. However, an order was passed
        under <strong>[Article]</strong> of the Constitution, stating that one
        more opportunity be granted to both ArcelorMittal and Numetal to pay off
        the NPAs of their related corporate debtors within two weeks of the
        Supreme Court judgment, failing which the corporate debtor would go into
        liquidation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 18.10.2018, ArcelorMittal informed the resolution professional and
        the Committee of Creditors that it had made payments as per the Supreme
        Court's judgment dated 04.10.2018. However, Numetal did not make any
        such payment. As a result, on 19.10.2018, ArcelorMittal resubmitted its
        resolution plan of 02.04.2018, which was then evaluated by the Committee
        of Creditors on the same date ArcelorMittal being declared as the
        highest evaluated resolution applicant vis-a-vis Vedanta. On 25.10.2018,
        the final negotiated resolution plan of ArcelorMittal was approved by
        the Committee of Creditors by a 92.24% majority. After several
        proceedings before the NCLT and the NCLAT, the NCLT, by its judgment
        dated 08.03.2019 disposed of the application to allow the resolution
        plan filed by ArcelorMittal.

        <u>PARA 12:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 12: Before the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, Entry 33 List
        I invested the Parliament with power to enact laws with respect to
        acquisition or requisitioning for the purpose of the Union, and Entry 36
        List II conferred upon the State Legislature the power to legislate with
        respect to acquisition or requisitioning for the remaining purposes.
        Those entries are now deleted, and a single Entry 42 List III invests
        the Parliament and the State Legislatures with power to legislate with
        respect to "acquisition and requisitioning" of property.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Entry 42 in the Concurrent List power was conferred upon the
        Parliament and the State Legislatures to legislate with respect to
        "Principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned
        for the purpose of the Union or for any other public purpose is to be
        determined, and the form in which such compensation is to be given".
        Power to legislate for acquisition of property is exercisable only under
        Entry 42 of List III, and not as an incident of the power to legislate
        in respect of a specific head of legislation in any of the three lists:
        Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation Ltd. v. The State of Andhra.
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Under that entry "property" can be compulsorily acquired. In its normal
        connotation "property" means the "highest right a man can have to
        anything, being that right which one has to lands or tenements, goods or
        chattels which does not depend on another's courtesy : it includes
        ownership, estates and interests in corporeal things, and also rights
        such as trade-marks, copyrights, patents and even rights in personam
        capable of transfer or transmission, such as debts; and signifies a
        beneficial right to or a thing considered as having a money value, I
        especially with reference to transfer or succession, and to their
        capacity of being injured". &nbsp;The expression "undertaking" in s. 4
        of Act 22 of 1969 clearly means a going concern with all its rights,
        liabilities and assets-as distinct from the various rights and assets
        which compose it. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 6, Art.
        75 at p. 43, it is stated that "Although various ingredients go to make
        up an undertaking, the term describes not the ingredients but the
        completed work from which the earnings arise."
