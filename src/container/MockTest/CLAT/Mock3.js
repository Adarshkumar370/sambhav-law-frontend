        <u>PARA 1:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 1: The first reason is because sharing information widely is in
        itself an important tool in combating public tragedies, like the current
        COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>[Case 1] </strong>one of us (DY Chandrachud,
        J) speaking for four Judges of a nine-Judge bench of this Court noted
        academic literature documenting the widespread availability of
        information and the resultant acknowledgement of the problem is what
        prevented the drought in Maharashtra in 1973 from becoming as bad as the
        Bengal Famine of 1943, where the British tried to deny the problem even
        existed. It was noted thus:{" "}
        <em>
          &ldquo;267. Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights do
          not exist in a state of antagonism. The conditions necessary for
          realising or fulfilling socio-economic rights do not postulate the
          subversion of political freedom. The reason for this is simple.
          Socio-economic entitlements must yield true benefits to those for whom
          they are intended. This can be achieved by eliminating rent-seeking
          behaviour and by preventing the capture of social welfare benefits by
          persons who are not entitled to them. Capture of social welfare
          benefits can be obviated only when political systems are transparent
          and when there is a free flow of information. Opacity ensures to the
          benefit of those who monopolise scarce economic resources.&rdquo;
        </em>{" "}
        As such, preventing clampdowns on sharing of information on online
        platforms is not just in the interest of individuals sharing the
        information, but the larger democratic structures of our nation. Without
        the ready availability of such information, it is entirely possible that
        the COVID-19 pandemic may turn into a tragedy worse than what it already
        is.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Medical oxygen is critical to treatment of COVID affected patients.
          The entire available capacity of oxygen is used for supply for
          industrial and medical use, which is in the form of Liquid Medical
          Oxygen. The major suppliers for both industrial and medical oxygen are
          steel plants in the public and private sectors, and private entities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oxygen is produced evenly in India. All States shall be producing
          oxygen. States/UT such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, Delhi,
          Goa and Madhya Pradesh have large production capacity and so states
          should not rely on supply of oxygen from other States.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the basis of the categorization provided by Empowered Group I,
          oxygen requirement of different States on the basis of active cases is
          being calculated which is around 8462 MT. Based on the trend of active
          cases, the &ldquo;doubling rate of cases&rdquo; is calculated for each
          State, which implies, the number of days in which COVID cases are
          likely to double. The number of active cases is projected on the basis
          of the doubling rate and oxygen requirement is calculated. These
          projections get changed daily on the basis of real time change.
        </li>
        <li>
          In order to ensure supply of oxygen to all States, a mapping exercise
          of the sources of supplies with the demand of medical oxygen to the
          critically affected States was undertaken jointly by the Department of
          Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, MoHFW, Ministry of Steel,
          Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, oxygen manufacturers
          etc. During the course of the mapping exercise, States were requested
          to indicate their projections for requirement of medical oxygen based
          on expected active case load.

        <u>PARA 2:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 2: I regret my inability to agree that laying an Ordinance
        promulgated by the Governor of a State before the State Legislature is
        mandatory under <strong>[Article 1]</strong> of the Constitution and the
        failure to lay an Ordinance before the State Legislature results in the
        Ordinance not having the force and effect as a law enacted and would be
        of no consequence whatsoever. In my opinion, it is not mandatory under{" "}
        <strong>[Article 1]</strong> of the Constitution to lay an Ordinance
        before the Legislative Assembly of the State Legislature, nor would the
        failure to do so result in the Ordinance not having the force and effect
        as an enacted law or being of no consequence whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, in my opinion, an Ordinance cannot create an enduring or
        irreversible right in a citizen. Consequently, and with respect, a
        contrary view expressed by this Court in <strong>[Case 1]</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>[Case 2] </strong>requires to be overruled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as the re-promulgation of an Ordinance is concerned, I am of
        opinion that the re-promulgation of an Ordinance by the Governor of a
        State is not per se a fraud on the Constitution. There could be
        exigencies requiring the re-promulgation of an Ordinance. However,
        re-promulgation of an Ordinance ought not to be a mechanical exercise
        and a responsibility rests on the Governor to be satisfied that
        &ldquo;circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take
        immediate action&rdquo; for promulgating or re-promulgating an
        Ordinance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I am of the view that in the absence of any challenge by the
        employees to the first three Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of
        the State of Bihar, their validity must be assumed. Consequently, even
        though these three Ordinances may have been repealed, the employees
        would be entitled to the benefits under them till they ceased to operate
        and the benefits obtained by the employees under these three Ordinances
        are justified. However, these three Ordinances do not confer any
        enduring or irreversible right or benefits on the employees. The
        promulgation of the fourth and subsequent Ordinances has not been
        adequately justified by the State of Bihar in spite of a specific
        challenge by the employees and therefore they were rightly struck down
        by the High Court. Therefore, I partly agree with brother Chandrachud on
        the issue of the validity of the Ordinances.

        <u>PARA 3:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 3: NCLAT ought to have granted the reliefs sought. For ease of
        reference, the reliefs granted by the Ld. NCLAT under the various heads
        of oppression as against certain key reliefs sought by the Appellants,
        which the Ld. NCLAT has not granted and which the appellants are
        aggrieved by, are summarized below:&shy;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Reliefs granted by the Ld. Reliefs that ought to have been NCLAT
        granted by the Ld. NCLAT in light of the findings rendered and the
        reliefs sought for Ousting of nominee of the SP Group as Director of
        Tata Sons R&shy;11 should be reinstated as R&shy;11 has himself stated
        clearly Executive Chairman and that he had no intent to once again
        Director, for the rest of his tenure taken charge of Executive of Tata
        Sons and as Director of Chairman and Director of the Tata three Tata
        Group Companies Group companies. Given the from whose board he was
        nature of Tata Sons being that of a removed. two group company and the
        huge stake that the appellants have in Tata Sons, the relief that ought
        to have been granted was that the appellants be granted proportionate
        representation on the Board of Directors of Tata Sons and representation
        on all committees formed by the Board of Directors of Tata
        Sons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, the relief of reinstatement granted by the
        Tribunal, was too big a pill even for the complainant companies (and
        perhaps CPM) to swallow.

      <p>
        Relief relating to <strong>[Article]</strong>. The larger questions
        revolving around the attack to <strong>[Article]</strong>, particularly
        the question whether the very presence of such an article could be
        construed as oppressive and prejudicial to some members, will be dealt
        with in the next chapter concerning question of law No.3. But we shall
        consider here, the limited question whether the Tribunal could have
        granted a relief, that has the effect of sending{" "}
        <strong>[Article] </strong>into comatose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, the relief in respect of <strong>[Article],</strong>{" "}
        technically speaking, could not have been granted by NCLAT. The reason
        is that in the Company Petition as it was originally filed, there was no
        prayer challenging <strong>[Article].</strong> It was only through an
        application for amendment dated 31.10.2017 that the complainant
        companies sought to incorporate a prayer as Clause M&shy;2 for striking
        off/ deleting <strong>[Article] </strong>on the ground that it is a tool
        in the hands of majority shareholders to oppress the minority. In the
        said application for amendment filed on 31.10.2017, the complainant
        companies sought to include five additional prayers, three of them as
        Clauses M&shy;1, M&shy;2 and M&shy;3, one of them as Clause F&shy;1 and
        the last as Clause G&shy;1. The prayer for striking off/deleting{" "}
        <strong>[Article]</strong> was sought to be included in Clause M&shy;2
        of Para 153 of the main petition.

        <u>PARA 4:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 4: In this regard it may be noted that the issue of the use of
        sound amplifying devices for amplifying human voice and other sounds
        while offering daily pujas by a Hindu Organization arose before the
        Calcutta High Court in the <strong>[Case 1],</strong> wherein it was
        held as under:{" "}
        <em>
          &ldquo;. It is well-settled that the right to propagate one's religion
          means the right to communicate a person's belief to another or to
          expose the tenets of that faith. The question is whether the right to
          propagate religion includes the right to use loud-speakers and
          microphones for the purpose of chanting religious tenets or religious
          texts and/or the indiscriminate use of microphones or loud-speakers
          during religious performance in the society. There cannot be any
          dispute that sound is a known source of pollution. The adverse and ill
          effect of sound on human body is also known. It has a tremendous
          impact on the nervous system of human being. The religion that has
          been performed by the petitioner and others, is nothing new, but the
          same is there for several centuries. It cannot be said that the
          religious teachers or the spiritual leaders who had laid down these
          tenets, had any way desired the use of microphones as a means of
          performance of religion. Undoubtedly, one can practise, profess and
          propagate religion, as guaranteed under [<strong>Article 1]</strong>{" "}
          of the Constitution, but that is not an absolute right. The provisions
          of <strong>[Article 1]</strong> are subject to the provisions of
          Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. On true and proper construction
          of the provisions of Article 25(1), read with Article 19(1)(a) of the
          Constitution, it cannot be said that a citizen should be coerced to
          hear anything which he does not like or which he does not
          require.&rdquo;
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, the issue of using sound amplifying devices for the
        purposes of reciting Azan was specifically dealt with by the Calcutta
        High Court in the <strong>[Case 2],</strong> The claim in the Writ
        Petition was that Namaz is the second pillar of Islam and occupies a
        permanent position among the practical duties of the Muslims. It was
        claimed that use of microphones for the purpose of Azan is a part of the
        religious right guaranteed under <strong>[Article 1]</strong> of the
        Constitution of India. After detailed discussions the Calcutta High
        Court while recognizing that Azan was certainly an essential part of
        Islam, held that the use of microphone and loud&shy;speakers were not an
        essential and an integral part of Azan.

        <u>PARA 5:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 5: After considering all the guidelines, an advocate should be
        punished by exercising extreme caution only in the case where the
        tendency is to create disaffection and disrepute to erode the judicial
        system. Though the convicting judgment, on the one hand cites various
        decision on balance, on the contrary holds the contemnor guilty for the
        fair criticism made by him. There is no conflict between the
        constitutional jurisdiction under Articles 129, 215 of the Constitution
        of India, and <strong>[Act 1]. </strong>In <strong>[Case1],</strong> it
        was laid down that the powers of punishment for contempt under{" "}
        <strong>[Article]</strong> of the Constitution of India have to be
        exercised in consonance with <strong>[Act 1]</strong>. Besides that,
        provisions in Sections 8 and 9 and newly amended Section 13(a) of the{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1]</strong> requires that the Court cannot impose a
        sentence unless it is satisfied that contempt is of such a nature that
        substantially interferes or tends substantially to interfere with the
        due course of Justice. Thus, special responsibility is cast on the Court
        to examine the extent of interference. The provisions of newly amended
        Section 13(a) amply make it clear that the Court is required to assess
        the situation Itself. However, in the convicting judgment no such
        inquiry has taken place and as such an order of sentence cannot be
        passed. Truth should ordinarily be allowed as a defence unless the Court
        finds, that it is only a camouflage to escape the consequences of the
        deliberate attempt of scandalizing the Court.{" "}
        <strong>[Section 1]</strong> of the <strong>[Act 1]</strong> enables the
        Court to permit justification by truth as a valid defence in any
        contempt proceedings if it satisfied that such a defence is in the
        public interest and the request for invoking the defence is bona fide.
        Reliance is placed on [Case 2].

        <u>PARA 6:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 6: Reserve Bank of India issued a &ldquo;Statement on Developmental
        and Regulatory Policies&rdquo; on April 5, 2018, paragraph 13 of which
        directed the entities regulated by RBI (i) not to deal with or provide
        services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling
        virtual currencies and (ii) to exit the relationship, if they already
        have one, with such individuals/ business entities, dealing with or
        settling virtual currencies. Following the said Statement, RBI also
        issued a circular dated April 6, 2018, in exercise of the powers
        conferred by Section 35A read with Section 36(1)(a) and Section 56 of
        the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 45JA and 45L of the Reserve
        Bank of India Act, 1934 and Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of the
        Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, directing the entities
        regulated by RBI (i) not to deal in virtual currencies nor to provide
        services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or
        settling virtual currencies and (ii) to exit the relationship with such
        persons or entities, if they were already providing such services to
        them. The impugned Circular dated 06-04-2018 was set aside on the ground
        of proportionality. The Statement dated 05-04-2018, though challenged is
        not in the nature of a statutory direction and hence the question of
        setting aside the same did not arise.

        <u>PARA 7:</u>
      </p>
      <p>Para 7: The learned counsel contended that the tape-</p>
      <p>
        recorded conversation has been relied on without there being any
        certificate under <strong>[Section].</strong> It was contended that
        audio tapes are recorded on magnetic media, the same could be
        established through a certificate under<strong> [Section] </strong>and
        in the absence of the certificate, the document which constitutes
        electronic record, cannot be deemed to be a valid evidence and has to be
        ignored from consideration. Reliance has been placed by the learned
        counsel on the judgment of this Court in <strong>[Case].</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The conversation on the landline phone of the complainant situate in a
        shop was recorded by the complainant. The same cassette containing
        conversation by which ransom call was made on the landline phone was
        handed over by the complainant in original to the police. This Court in
        its judgment dated 25-1-2010 has referred to the aforesaid fact and has
        noted the said fact to the following effect:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The cassette on which the conversations had been recorded on the
        landline was handed over by Ravi Verma to SI Jiwan Kumar and on a replay
        of the tape, the conversation was clearly audible and was heard by the
        police.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The tape-recorded conversation was not secondary evidence which required
        certificate under <strong>[Section],</strong> since it was the original
        cassette by which ransom call was tape-recorded, there cannot be any
        dispute that for admission of secondary evidence of electronic record a
        certificate as contemplated by [<strong>Section]</strong> is a mandatory
        condition.&rdquo;

        Para 8: For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the
        challenge to the constitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2018 is
        lacking in substance. Following the decision in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, the State government duly carried out the
        exercise of collating and analysing data on the compelling factors
        adverted to by the Constitution Bench in <strong>[Case 3]</strong>. The
        Reservation Act 2018 has cured the deficiency which was noticed by{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong> in respect of the Reservation Act 2002. The
        Reservation Act 2018 does not amount to a usurpation of judicial power
        by the state legislature. It is <strong>[Case 2]</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>[Case 3]</strong> compliant. The Reservation Act 2018 is a valid
        exercise of the enabling power conferred by Article 16 (4A) of the
        Constitution. We therefore find no merit in the batch of writ petitions
        as the constitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2018 has been
        upheld. They shall stand dismissed. Accordingly, the review petitions
        and miscellaneous applications shall also stand dismissed in view of the
        judgment in the present case. There shall be no order as to costs. All
        pending applications are disposed of.

      <p>
        Para 9: <strong>[Case 1]</strong> does not contain a reference to{" "}
        <strong>[Case 2].</strong> The decision of the majority in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong> is essentially divided into two parts; the
        first dealing with the validity of a regulation for nocturnal
        domiciliary visits (which was struck down) and the second dealing with
        the rest of the regulation (which was upheld). The decision on the first
        part, which dealt with Regulation 236(b) conveys an inescapable
        impression that the regulation invaded the sanctity of the home and was
        a violation of ordered liberty. Though the reasoning of the Court does
        not use the expression &lsquo;privacy&rsquo;, it alludes to the one of
        the cases of the US Supreme Court, which deals with privacy. Besides,
        the portion extracted in the judgment has a reference to privacy
        specifically at two places. While holding domiciliary visits at night to
        be invalid, the Court drew sustenance from the right to life under
        Article 21 which means something more than a mere animal existence. The
        right under Article 21 includes the enjoyment of those faculties which
        render the right meaningful. Hence, the first part of the decision in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong> represents an amalgam of life, personal
        liberty and privacy. It protects interests which are grounded in privacy
        under the rubric of liberty. The difficulty in construing the decision
        arises because in the second part of its decision, the majority upheld
        the rest of the regulation and observed (while doing so) that there is
        an absence of a protected right to privacy under the Constitution. These
        observations in the second part are at variance with those dealing with
        the first. The view about the absence of a right to privacy is an
        isolated observation which cannot coexist with the essential
        determination rendered on the first aspect of the regulation.

      <p>
        Para 11: As per the social solidarity theory of <strong>[1]</strong>,
        man, being a social animal is dependent on the society for fulfilment of
        his needs. If he has to live in the society, he must act in conformity
        with the social law of solidarity. Solidarity is nothing but moral
        duties. He says, &ldquo;Man must so act that he does nothing which may
        injure social solidarity upon which he depends, and more positively, he
        must do all which naturally tends to promote social solidarity&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        What was done by the Union Carbide Corporation and the Indian Government
        not only hampered social solidarity but also shook the concept of social
        contract. The way Anderson was helped to escape India and go scot free,
        by the so called &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; has raised a question
        on&nbsp;&lsquo;pactumunionis&rsquo; and &lsquo;pactumsubjectionis&rsquo;
        &nbsp;of the social contract theory of Rousseau , Hobbes and Locke. The
        leaders who were elected to defend the life, property and liberty of
        people sided with the wrong doer, keeping aside the ideals of truth,
        dharma and justice. &lsquo;Cherry on the cake&rsquo; was The Bhopal Gas
        Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985 which was passed to make
        the union government representative of the victims of the Bhopal Gas
        Tragedy and filing suits on behalf of them. Though the Act was passed in
        conformity with parens patriae doctrine which obliges the state to
        protect its citizens, the intent seems to be different. The government
        in the form of this Act got the legal shield to commit something that
        cannot be said to be legal. Though the court got an opportunity to
        review this Act in Charanlal Sahoo v. Union of India but it failed to
        recognise that the Union of India was colliding with the Union Carbide
        Corporation and compromising the interests of the victims.&nbsp; The
        fault cannot be said to have been from the government&rsquo;s side only,
        the management of the &lsquo;killer&rsquo; factory is equally
        responsible; Contrary to the safety rules, Union Carbide factory stored
        not only stored 42 tons of Methyl Iscocynide in tank No. 610 but also
        failed to prevent the pipelines and tank from corrosion, which
        accelerated the reaction between MIC and water that entered the tank due
        to &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; from company&rsquo;s side.This cannot merely be
        termed as mistake; rather negligence is more appropriate term. It can be
        logically deducted according to the social solidarity theory, that every
        member of the society is expected to take reasonable measures and care
        to ensure that the life of other members of the society is not

        <u>PARA 12:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 12: Learned Additional Solicitor General argued for the appellant,
        stating that the High Court erred in granting bail without adverting to
        the statutory rigours of [Act 1]. Relying upon judgment in [Case 1], it
        was highlighted that bail proceedings under the special enactment were
        distinct and the Courts are dutybound to refuse bail where the suspect
        is prima facie guilty. It was further contended that the fact that the
        respondent had absconded for years makes apprehension towards his bail
        even more legitimate. Concerning the early conclusion of the trial, he
        contended that the NIA had filed an additional affidavit to examine 276
        witnesses. At the same time, the NIA was expecting to conduct the trial
        on a day-to-day basis and complete it within a year. The learned counsel
        appearing for the respondent highlighted that many of the co-accused had
        been acquitted and those who were held convicts had also been awarded a
        sentence of not more than eight years. Given how the respondent has
        already suffered incarceration of almost five-and-a-half years without
        the trial, &lsquo;violate his Constitutional liberty and rights to have
        him serve most of his sentence without any adjudication of guilt by a
        judicial authority&rsquo;. He urged that once the High Court had
        exercised discretion to grant bail, the same ought not to be interfered
        with except in rare circumstances. Relying upon [Case 2], he further
        contended, &ldquo;Such protracted incarceration violates the
        respondent&rsquo;s right to a speedy trial and access to justice; in
        which case, Constitutional Courts could exercise their powers to grant
        bail, regardless of limitations specified under special
        enactments.&rdquo; It was reiterated that at the time of deciding an
        application for bail, it would be necessary to record reasons, albeit
        without evaluating the evidence on merits. Counsel also stated that
        numerous judgments enshrine the liberty guaranteed by Part III of the
        Constitution which within its protective ambit gives access to justice
        and a speedy trial.
