      <p>
        Para 1: Concerning the provisions contained in{" "}
        <strong>[Section]</strong>, suffice it to observe that with respect to
        preliminary inquiry for registration of FIR, we have already recalled
        the general directions (iii) and (iv) issued in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]</strong>. A preliminary inquiry is permissible only in
        the circumstances as per the law laid down by a Constitution Bench of
        this Court in <strong>[Case 2]</strong>, shall hold good as explained in
        the order passed by this Court in the review petitions on 1.10.2019 and
        the amended provisions of <strong>[Section]</strong> have to be
        interpreted accordingly. The <strong>[Section] </strong>was inserted
        owing to the decision of this Court in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, which
        made it necessary to obtain the approval of the appointing authority
        concerning a public servant and the SSP in the case of arrest of accused
        persons. This Court has also recalled that direction on Review Petition
        (Crl.) No.228 of 2018 decided on 1.10.2019. Thus, the provisions which
        have been made&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; <strong>[Section]</strong>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; rendered&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
        academic&nbsp;&nbsp; use&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp;
        were enacted to take care of mandate issued in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1] </strong>which no more prevails. The provisions were
        already in section 18 of the Act with respect to anticipatory bail.

        <u>PARA 4:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 4: Even as of today, Section 497 IPC continues to be on the statute
        book. When these sections are wholly outdated and have outlived their
        purpose, not only does the maxim of Roman law, cessante ratione legis,
        cessat ipsa lex, apply to interdict such law, but when such law falls
        foul of constitutional guarantees, it is this Court&rsquo;s solemn duty
        not to wait for legislation but to strike down such law. As recently as
        in [<strong>Case 1</strong>], it is only the minority view of Khehar,
        C.J.I. and S. Abdul Nazeer, J., that one must wait for the law to change
        legislatively by way of social reform. The majority view was the exact
        opposite, which is why Triple Talaq was found constitutionally infirm
        and struck down by the majority. Also, we are of the view that the
        statement in this judgment that stability of marriages is not an ideal
        to be scorned, can scarcely be applied to this provision, as we have
        seen that marital stability is not the object for which this provision
        was enacted. On all these counts, therefore, we overrule the judgment in
        [<strong>Case 2]</strong>. Equally, the judgment in [
        <strong>Case 3</strong>], which upheld the constitutional validity of
        Section 198 must, for similar reasons, be held to be no longer good law.
        We, therefore, declare that Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
        and Section 198 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are violative of
        Articles 14, 15(1), and 21 of the Constitution of India and are,
        therefore, struck down as being invalid.

      <p>
        Para 6: We thus have two categories of cases. The first, similar to the
        one dealt with in <strong>[Case 1]</strong> where the Managing Director
        himself is named as an arbitrator with an additional power to appoint
        any other person as an arbitrator. In the second category, the Managing
        Director is not to act as an arbitrator himself but is empowered or
        authorised to appoint any other person of his choice or discretion as an
        arbitrator. If, in the first category of cases, the Managing Director
        was found incompetent, it was because of the interest that he would be
        said to be having in the outcome or result of the dispute. The element
        of invalidity would thus be directly relatable to and arise from the
        interest that he would be having in such outcome or decision. If that be
        the test, similar invalidity would always arise and spring even in the
        second category of cases. If the interest that he has in the outcome of
        the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the possibility of bias, it
        will always be present irrespective of whether the matter stands under
        the first or second category of cases. We are conscious that if such
        deduction is drawn from the decision of this Court in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1],</strong> all cases having clauses similar to that with
        which we are presently concerned, a party to the agreement would be
        disentitled to make any appointment of an Arbitrator on its own and it
        would always be available to argue that a party or an official or an
        authority having interest in the dispute would be disentitled to make
        appointment of an Arbitrator.

      <p>
        Para 7: In [<strong>Case 1],</strong> the Legislature, in its wisdom,
        enacted [<strong>Act 1],</strong> which has its share of supporters and
        opponents. The Legislature performed its task. A section of the society,
        aggrieved by this legislative amendment, has filed petitions before this
        Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, assailing the
        constitutionality and legality of this amendment, which is pending
        consideration. There is no stay of the legislation for the purpose of
        record. There have been protests against this legislation in Delhi and
        in different parts of the country. The grievance made in the Writ
        petition (Civil No. 429/2020) was that the persons opposing{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1] </strong>and the National Register of Citizens, the
        details of which were yet to be propounded, had adopted a method of
        protest which resulted in the closure of the Kalindi Kunj- Shaheen Bagh
        stretch, including the Okhla underpass from 15.12.2019. It was submitted
        that the public roads could not be permitted to be encroached upon in
        this manner and, thus, a direction be issued to clear the same. Learned
        counsel for the applicants Mr. Mehmood Pracha has sought to canvass that
        there was an absolute right of peaceful protest, both in respect of
        space and numbers. He submitted that the right under
        <strong> [Article</strong> X] of the Constitution of India are only
        circumscribed by the provisions of Clauses (2) &amp; (3), and the only
        applicable aspect would be &lsquo;public order&rsquo;, but such
        restriction must be reasonable in character. On the other hand, the
        appellant herein sought to contend that such a situation should be
        avoided in the future and some norms may be laid down. In the&nbsp; [
        <strong>Case 2]</strong> a challenge was made to the rules framed by the
        Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad, by the powers conferred under Section
        33(1)(o) of <strong>[Act 2].</strong> One of these rules required prior
        permission to be taken for the holding of public meetings and any
        guidance as to when such permission to hold a public meeting may be
        refused, it was found that the same conferred arbitrary powers and gave
        an unguided discretion to the concerned authority, and this was
        accordingly held to be ultra vires&nbsp;<strong>[Article X]</strong> of
        the Constitution.

        Para 8: On that basis, income was taken at Rs.18,000/- per month to
        which 50% was added towards future prospects, following the judgment of
        this Court in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>.&nbsp; Deduction towards
        personal expenses was made on which multiplier of 13 was applied. The
        aforesaid cases are of all those victims who were students at the time
        of accident and were not in actual employment.&nbsp; In addition, Mr.
        Arun Mohan had also referred to the judgment in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 2] </strong>where victim of an accident was a young
        advocate aged about 36 years.&nbsp; In the accident, he sustained whole
        body disability of 50%.&nbsp; This judgment is cited for the purpose of
        showing principle laid down by the Court in determining the loss of
        earning capacity of an advocate who suffers disability in an accident.
        The Tribunal had assessed the loss of future income due to disability at
        Rs.6,17,500/- per annum. The High Court reduced the same to
        Rs.1,50,000/-. This Court noted that due to the said accident, the
        appellant had suffered partial sensory loss all over his limbs and there
        was lack of proper coordination in all four limbs.&nbsp; He needed an
        assistance for daily routine work. This kind of disability, in the
        opinion of the Court, hindered his ability to practice as an advocate
        and compete with others in the field of legal profession. He was bound
        to suffer huge professional loss in the said condition.&nbsp;

        <u>PARA 9:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 9: We must, however, advert to a decision of this Court in Surinder
        Singh Deswal and Ors. vs. Virender Gandhi where Section 148 of the Act
        which was also introduced by the same Amendment Act 20 of 2018 from
        01.09.2018 was held by this Court to be retrospective in operation. As
        against <strong>[Section]</strong> of the Act which applies at the trial
        stage that is even before the pronouncement of guilt or order of
        conviction, Section 148 of the Act applies at the appellate stage where
        the accused is already found guilty of the offence under Section 138 of
        the Act. It may be stated that there is no provision in Section 148 of
        the Act which is similar to Sub-Section (5) of{" "}
        <strong>[Section]</strong> of the Act. However, as a matter of fact, no
        such provision akin to sub-section (5) of <strong>[Section]</strong> was
        required as Sections 421 and 357 of the Code, which apply
        post-conviction, are adequate to take care of such requirements. In that
        sense said Section 148 depends upon the existing machinery and
        principles already in existence and does not create any fresh disability
        of the nature similar to that created by <strong>[Section]</strong> of
        the Act. Therefore, the decision of this Court in Surinder Singh Deswal
        stands on a different footing. In the ultimate analysis, we hold{" "}
        <strong>[Section]</strong> to be prospective in operation and that the
        provisions of said <strong>[Section]</strong> can be applied or invoked
        only in cases where the offence under Section 138 of the Act was
        committed after the introduction of said <strong>[Section]</strong> in
        the statute book. Consequently, the orders passed by the Trial Court as
        well as the High Court are required to be set aside. The money deposited
        by the Appellant, pursuant to the interim direction passed by this
        Court, shall be returned to the Appellant along with interest accrued
        thereon within two weeks from the date of this order.

        Para 10: Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel, who was permitted to
        intervene in-person, has supported the stand of the Union of India so
        far as the modification of the interim order is concerned. Though Mr.
        Sajan Poovayya, learned senior counsel, has filed a separate writ
        petition relating to some other aspect, he submitted that the word
        ―secular that finds place in the Preamble is meant for integration of
        the diverse communities existing in India and the said principle has
        been recognized in the context of the Flag Code in the{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1]. </strong>He has drawn our attention to paragraph 27 of
        the judgment which we think it seemly to reproduce: ―Then the question
        arises, which view is to be accepted. National Anthem, National Flag and
        National Song are secular symbols of the nationhood. They represent the
        supreme collective expression of commitment and loyalty to the nation as
        well as patriotism for the Country. They are necessary adjuncts of
        sovereignty being symbols and actions associated therewith. Emphasizing
        on the aforesaid passage, he would contend that both the National Anthem
        and the National Flag and the National Song being secular symbols
        representing the nationhood command (2004) 2 SCC 510 desired respect. He
        has also drawn our attention to the statement made by the President of
        the Constituent Assembly.

        <u>PARA 11:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 11: The court didn&rsquo;t distinguish between justification and
        excuse properly. The classical view treats the defence of necessity as a
        powerful excuse whereas the modern view characterizes it as a
        justification but fails to capture the sort of justification it is.
        Although Aristotle&rsquo;s Magna Moralia says, &ldquo;what is done from
        necessity is involuntary not accompanied by thought.&rdquo; It makes no
        effect in the verdict in the case. Necessity as an excuse would result
        in the defendant as criminal but not punishable. Using necessity as an
        excuse would gradually weaken the system, allowing the defence would
        encourage people to overrate the danger to which they are exposed and
        yield quickly to temptation. Moreover, necessity provides limited
        justification by just making the act morally permissible but will not
        ensure that the act is the best possible option to carry out in a
        certain circumstance. Secondly, the intrusion on the victim&rsquo;s
        interests undermines his/her integrity. The choice of killing the boy by
        the two defendants is based on the principles of Utilitarianism. Given
        by Jeremy Bentham, the principle suggests that &ldquo;the just thing to
        do is to maximize utility&rdquo; that is, the balance of pleasure over
        pain, happiness over sorrow. This principal basis morality on maximizing
        pleasure. It focuses on the greater good for the greater number of
        people. The morality of certain act consists in weighing the costs and
        benefits of the act. The consequentialist moral reasoning is along these
        lines, the right thing to do depends on the consequences of an act. The
        act of killing Parker is justified in the defendants&rsquo; view and is
        supported by these principles. The defendants were maximizing the
        pleasure or happiness for themselves and if in the way they murder
        someone, in their eyes they did no wrong as their actions had a good
        consequence i.e., their own survival, therefore their act is good. The
        principle, in this case, results in people taking the law in their own
        hands. There is a clash in this point. These principles are clearly
        violated if we look at things from the boy&rsquo;s perspective. His
        death will not, in any case, maximize his pleasure or happiness neither
        would it fit for being a good action as the consequence for him is bad.
        Here we come across the concept of categorical moral reasoning. It is
        put forth by Immanuel Kant, which suggests that it is not just the
        consequence of an act but also its intrinsic quality i.e., certain
        duties and rights must command our respect and should be intrinsically
        wrong or right<strong>. </strong>The theory of Moral Absolutism runs
        along the same line suggesting that there are absolute standards against
        which moral questions can be judged meaning that some actions are
        intrinsically right or wrong regardless of the beliefs and goals of the
        society and individual. Immanuel Kant was a promoter of this idea.

        <strong>[Case 1],</strong> the relevant facts with regard to: the date
        of filing of the respective application under <strong>[Act 1] </strong>
        and the date of pronouncement of the order. He opened his submissions by
        pointing out that two questions arise for consideration in these writ
        petitions, namely, whether writ petitions are maintainable after the
        introduction of section 17 (4-A) of the given Act and whether the
        District Magistrate has jurisdiction to pass orders after expiry of the
        outer limit of 60 days, which is prescribed by the amendment. With
        specific reference to WP 11986 of 2019, he submitted that the petition
        under <strong>[Act 1]</strong> does not contain requisite details such
        as the amount outstanding, whether the notice under section 13 (2) was
        replied to and other details relating to the existence of security
        interest. In this regard, he referred to the proviso to{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1] </strong>which stipulates that an affidavit should be
        filed wherein the above-mentioned details should be specified. In this
        connection, he emphasised that there was no time limit for deciding
        petitions under <strong>[Act 1]</strong> until the amendment was
        introduced. He also referred to sub- section 3 of{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1]</strong> wherein it is specified that no act of the
        District Magistrate can be challenged before a court or authority and
        that, therefore, there is no statutory appeal against an order passed
        under [<strong>Act 1].</strong> In <strong>[Case 2],</strong> a Division
        Bench of the Allahabad High Court held that a provision requiring a
        meeting to be held within 30 days is mandatory and also reiterated the
        rule in Taylor vs. Taylor.
