          <u>PARA 1</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 1: Similarly,&nbsp;<strong>[Article]</strong> empowers the
          appropriate Legislature to enact legislation to provide for
          adjudication or trial by Tribunals of any disputes, complaints or
          offences with respect to the matters specified in Clause (2) of the
          said Article. The matters specified in&nbsp;<strong>[Article]</strong>{" "}
          Clause (2)&nbsp;exhaustively deal with a variety of matters which can
          be brought within the purview of tribalization by both the Parliament
          and State Legislatures.

          This Court has observed through numerous decisions that the term
          &lsquo;Tribunal&rsquo; refers to a quasi-judicial authority. A test to
          determine whether a particular body was merely an administrative organ
          of the Executive or a Tribunal was evolved by this Court
          in&nbsp;Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd., Meerut vs. Lakshmi chand. It was to
          be examined whether the body is vested with powers of a Civil Court or
          not, and it was held that any adjudicatory body vested with powers of
          taking evidence, summoning of witnesses, etc. must be categorized as a
          Tribunal. In R.K. Jain vs. Union of India14 a three-judge Bench of
          this Court emphasised the need for a safe and sound justice delivery
          system adept at satisfying the confidence of litigants. It was further
          noted that since members of Tribunals discharge quasi-judicial
          functions, it is imperative that they possess requisite legal
          expertise, some judicial experience and an iota of legal training.
          Moreover, since Tribunals are constituted as substitutes to Courts,
          their efficacy in upholding the faith of litigants cannot be
          compromised. It was however observed that true delivery of justice by
          Tribunals was still a far-fetched idea since the mechanism for
          judicial review and remedy of appeal to the Supreme Court was costly
          and discouraging. People from remote areas often found their right to
          appeal being handicapped by geographical and financial constraints.
          Hence, it was suggested by this Court that newer fora be dispersed
          across the country and that members from the Bar also be included in
          the composition of such Tribunals. An urgent need to reform the
          working of tribunals and regular monitoring of their functioning was
          also stressed upon.

        <p>
          Para 2: It is the <strong>[Act 1] </strong>which today is known as the
          CBI.&nbsp; The origin of the organization has been succinctly traced
          by this Court in<strong> [Case 1] </strong>and the relevant details
          are available in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the report of this Court in{" "}
          <strong>[Case 1]</strong>. Shortly put and as already observed,
          investigation of anticorruption cases; economic offences and ordinary
          crimes of special importance have come to be vested in the CBI which
          exercises its jurisdiction in the territory of all States and Union
          Territories (with consent of the State Governments). The organization
          i.e. CBI has grown over the years in its role, power and importance
          and today has become the premier investigative and prosecution agency
          of the country. The high stature and the pre&shy;eminent position that
          the institution has acquired is largely on account of a strong
          perception of the necessity of having such a premier agency. Such a
          perception finds reflection in the conscious attempts of the
          Government of the day to introduce reforms, from time to time, so as
          to enable the institution to reach greater heights in terms of
          integrity, independence and confidence. A close look at such attempts
          will now be in order. In <strong>[Case 1] </strong>such&nbsp;&nbsp;
          developments&nbsp;&nbsp; have already been taken note of in
          detail.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendations of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Committee&nbsp;&nbsp; headed&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Shri&nbsp;&nbsp; N.N.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vohra&nbsp;&nbsp;
          constituted&nbsp;&nbsp; by Government Order No. S/7937/SS(ISP)/93
          dated 9th July, 1993 and those of the Independent Review Committee
          (IRC) constituted by Government Order No. 226/2/97&shy;AVD&shy;II
          dated 8th September, 1997 has had a major role to play in giving the
          CBI and the CVC their present shape and form and the pivotal role and
          position that these two bodies have come to occupy in the system of
          law enforcement in the country.&nbsp; Incidentally, the CVC had been
          in existence&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp;&nbsp;
          administrative&nbsp;&nbsp; body&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp;
          being&nbsp;&nbsp; established&nbsp;&nbsp; by Resolution
          No.24/7/64&shy;AVD dated 11th February, 1964 issued by the Central
          Government until conferment of statutory status by the CVC Act, 2003
          on the basis of recommendations of the IRC, summary of which with
          regard to the CBI and CVC may now be taken note of.

          <u>PARA 3</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 3: Samaraditya Pal in the Law of Contempt has very succinctly
          stated the legal position as follows: Although the law of contempt is
          largely governed by the 1971 Act, it is now settled law in India that
          the High Courts and the Supreme Court derive their jurisdiction and
          power from <strong>[Article 1]</strong>&nbsp; and
          <strong> [Article 2]</strong> of the Constitution. This situation
          results in giving scope for &ldquo;judicial self-dealing&rdquo;. The
          High Courts also enjoy similar powers like the Supreme Court under{" "}
          <strong>[Article 1] </strong>of the Constitution. The main argument of
          the alleged contemnors is that notice should have been issued in terms
          of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act&nbsp;and any violation
          of the Contempt of Courts Act&nbsp;would vitiate the entire
          proceedings. We do not accept this argument. In view of the fact that
          the power to punish for contempt of itself is a constitutional power
          vested in this Court, such power cannot be abridged or taken away even
          by legislative enactment. To appreciate the rival contention, we shall
          have to make reference to a number of decisions relied upon by both
          the parties. The first judgment on the point is Sukhdev Singh Sodhi v.
          The Chief Justice and Judges of the Pepsu High Court. It would be
          pertinent to mention that the said judgment was given in the context
          of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. The issue before this Court in
          the said case was whether contempt proceedings could said to be the
          proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr.PC) and the
          Supreme Court had the power to transfer the proceedings from one court
          to another under the Cr.PC. Rejecting the prayer for transfer, this
          Court held as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;&hellip;.We hold therefore that
          the Code of Criminal Procedure does not apply in matters of contempt
          triable by the High Court. The High Court can deal with it summarily
          and adopt its own procedure. All that is necessary is that the
          procedure is fair and that the contemner is made aware of the charge
          against him and given a fair and reasonable opportunity to defend
          himself. This rule was laid down by the Privy Council in In re Pollard
          (L.R. 2 P.C. 106 at 120) and was followed in India and in Burma in In
          re Vallabhdas and Ebrahim Mamoojee Parekh v. King Emperor. In our view
          that is still the law.&rdquo; A Constitution Bench of this Court in
          Shri C. K. Daphtary v. Shri O.P. Gupta was dealing with a case where
          the contemnor had published a pamphlet casting scurrilous aspersions
          on 2 Judges of this Court. During the course of argument, the
          contemnor raised a plea that all the evidence has not been furnished
          to him and made a request that the petitioner be asked to furnish the
          &ldquo;pamphlet&rdquo; or &ldquo;book&rdquo; annexed to the petition.
          The Court rejected this argument holding that the booklet/pamphlet had
          been annexed to the petition in original and the Court had directed
          that the matter be decided on affidavits.

          <u>PARA 4</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 4: It has to be kept in mind that when the children are incapable
          of giving consent, foisting compulsion of having Aadhaar card upon
          them would be totally disproportionate and would fail to meet the
          proportionality test. As the law exists today, a child can hold
          property, operate a bank account, be eligible to be a nominee in an
          insurance policy or a bank account or have any financial transaction
          only through a legal guardian who has to be a major of sound mind. In
          cases where a child is in conflict with the law, the child is given a
          special criminal trial under the <strong>[Act 1]</strong> there is a
          mandatory requirement for the records to be kept confidential and
          destroyed so that the criminal record of the child is not maintained.
          This is the position in law contained in Section 11 of the Indian
          Contract Act, 1872, Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,
          Section 39 of the Insurance Act, 1938, Section 90 of the Indian Penal
          Code (which provides that consent of the child who is under 12 years
          of age shall not be regarded as consent) etc. Thus, when a child is
          not competent to contract; not in a position to consent; barred from
          transferring property; prohibited from taking employment; and not
          allowed to open/operate bank accounts and, as a consequence, not in a
          position to negotiate her rights, thirsting upon compulsory
          requirement of holding Aadhaar would be an inviable inroad into their
          fundamental rights under Article 21. The restriction imposed on such a
          right in the form of an Aadhaar cannot be treated as constitutionally
          justified. We may also mention here that State is supposed to keep in
          mind the best interest of the children which is regarded as primary
          consideration in our Constitution in<strong> [Case 1]. </strong>

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A doctrine that grants the inherent power and authority of the state
            to protect persons who are legally unable to act on their own
            behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine means that when some particular provision of a statute
            offends or is against a constitutional limitation, but that
            provision is severable from the rest of the statute, only that
            offending provision will be declared void by the Court and not the
            entire statute.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine envisages that a public authority ought to maintain a
            sense of proportion between his particular goals and the means he
            employs to achieve those goals, so that his action impinges on the
            individual rights to the minimum extent to preserve the public
            interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine which protects the outsiders against the actions done
            by the company. Any person who enters into a contract with the
            company shall ensure that the transaction is authorised by the
            articles and memorandum of the company.

          <u>PARA 5</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 5: <strong>[Section 1]</strong> mandates that the provisions of
          summary trial of the Code shall apply &ldquo;as far as may be&rdquo;
          to trials of complaints under <strong>[Section 2].</strong> Section
          258 of the Code empowers the Magistrate to stop the proceedings at any
          stage for reasons to be recorded in writing and pronounce a judgment
          of acquittal in any summons case instituted otherwise than upon
          complaint. Section 258 of the Code is not applicable to a summons case
          instituted on a complaint. Therefore, Section 258 cannot come into
          play in respect of the complaints filed under{" "}
          <strong>[Section 2]</strong>. The judgment of this Court in Meters and
          Instruments in so far as it conferred power on the Trial Court to
          discharge an accused is not good law.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Support taken from the words &ldquo;as far as may be&rdquo; in{" "}
          <strong>[Section 1]</strong>is inappropriate. The words &ldquo;as far
          as may be&rdquo; in <strong>[Section 1]</strong> are used only in
          respect of applicability of Sections 262 to 265 of the Code and the
          summary procedure to be followed for trials under Chapter XVII.
          Conferring power on the court by reading certain words into provisions
          is impermissible. A judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to
          enlarge nor to contract it. Whatever temptations the statesmanship of
          policy-making might wisely suggest, construction must eschew
          interpolation and evisceration. He must not read in by way of
          creation. The Judge&rsquo;s duty is to interpret and apply the law,
          not to change it to meet the Judge&rsquo;s idea of what justice
          requires. The court cannot add words to a statute or read words into
          it which are not there.
        </p>
        <p>
          A close scrutiny of the judgments of this Court in Adalat Prasad
          (supra) and Subramaniam Sethuraman (supra) would show that they do not
          warrant any reconsideration. The Trial Court cannot be conferred with
          inherent power either to review or recall the order of issuance of
          process. As held J. Frankfurter, &ldquo;Of Law and Men: Papers and
          Addresses of Felix Frankfurter&rdquo;. <strong>[Case 1], </strong>[
          <strong>Case 2]</strong> above, this Court, in its anxiety to cut down
          delays in the disposal of complaints unde
          <strong>r [Section 2],</strong> has applied Section 258 to hold that
          the Trial Court has the power to discharge the accused even for
          reasons other than payment of compensation. However, amendment to the
          Act empowering the Trial Court to reconsider/recall summons may be
          considered on the recommendation of the Committee constituted by this
          Court which shall look into this aspect as well.

          would not amount to denial or violation of the principles of natural
          justice. This provision of&nbsp;<strong>[SECTION 1]</strong>{" "}
          (3)&nbsp;reinforces the time limit specified in&nbsp;
          <strong>[SECTION 1]</strong> (2)(a)&nbsp;of the Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Court in the case of&nbsp;<strong>[CASE 1]</strong> has held that
          &ldquo;if the provision is couched in prohibitive or negative
          language, it can rarely be directory, the use of peremptory language
          in a negative form is per se indicative of the interest that the
          provision is to be mandatory&rdquo;. Further,&nbsp;hardship cannot be
          a ground for changing the mandatory nature of the statute, as has been
          held by this Court in <strong>[CASE 2]</strong> and Fairgrowth
          Investments Ltd. vs Custodian (2004) 11 SCC.

            If the provision is couched in prohibitive or negative language, it
            can rarely be directory. The use of peremptory language in a
            negative form is per se indicative of the interest that the

            It has&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that

          <li>
            Equity and law are twin brothers and law should be applied and

            law.

          <li>
            In case where the statuary provision is plain and unambiguous, the
            court shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only
            because of the harsh consequences arising therefrom.

          Para 7: In <strong>[Case 1],</strong> The Advocate General, inter
          alia, argued that the Rent Control Act having received the assent of
          the President of India,<strong> [Act 1]</strong> thereof was protected
          by Article 138(2) read with Article 200 of the Constitution of India
          and was valid and enforceable. After hearing Counsel and the learned
          Advocate General for the State of Chhattisgarh, the Bench was of the
          view that the appeal involved a substantial question of law as to the
          interpretation of the Constitution, and accordingly referred the
          appeal to the Chief Justice of India, for assignment to a Constitution
          Bench of this Court, in terms of Article 145(3) of the Constitution.
          The Chief Justice has referred the appeal to this Bench. The learned
          Attorney General also referred to a recent judgment of a Division
          Bench of this Court rendered on <strong>[Case 2]</strong> striking
          down <strong>[ACT 2]</strong> as ultra vires the Constitution and
          beyond the scope of the powers of the State Legislature. Parliament
          and the State Legislatures derive their power to make laws from
          Article 245(1) of the Constitution of India and such power is subject
          to and/or limited by the provisions of the Constitution. While
          Parliament can make law for the whole or any part of the territory of
          India, the State Legislature can only make laws for the State or any
          part thereof, subject to the restrictions in the Constitution of
          India.

        <p>
          Para 8: &nbsp;The approach and reasoning in Salauddin were applied and
          reiterated by this Court, in&nbsp;<strong>[Case1]</strong> That
          decision further explained the scope of the provision that till the
          regular bail application of an accused, enjoying protection
          under&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1]</strong>&nbsp;is pending before the
          regular court he need not surrender and his protection will continue
          till the disposal of the regular bail application under&nbsp;Section
          437 or&nbsp;Section 439 , and that she or he has to move an
          application (for regular bail) after expiry of a certain duration as
          directed by the Court or if the Charge-sheet is submitted because
          regular courts cannot be bypassed. It was held, in{" "}
          <strong>[Case1]</strong> that:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;3....This Court further observed that anticipatory bail is
          granted in anticipation of arrest in non- bailable cases, but that
          does not mean that the regular court, which is to try the offender, is
          sought to be bypassed...By this, what the Court desired to convey was
          that an order of anticipatory bail does not ensure till the end of
          trial but it must be of limited duration as the regular court cannot
          be bypassed. The limited duration must be determined having regard to
          the facts of the case and the need to give the accused sufficient time
          to move the regular court for bail and to give the regular court
          sufficient time to determine the bail application. In other words,
          till the bail application is disposed of one way or the other the
          court may allow the accused to remain on anticipatory bail. &hellip;..
          This decision was not intended to convey that as soon as the accused
          persons are produced before the regular court the anticipatory bail
          ends even if the court is yet to decide the question of bail on
          merits. The decision in Salauddin case [(1996) 1 SCC 667] has to be so
          understood.&rdquo;

            three later decisions where this court applied the ratio in
            Salauddin and echoed the concern that the &ldquo;protective
            umbrella&rdquo; of&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1]</strong> cannot be
            extended beyond the time period indicated in the previous case
            (Salauddin) or till the applicant avails remedies up to high courts
            and that doing so would mean that the regular court would be
            bypassed.

        <ol>
          <li>
            When a person complains of apprehension of arrest and approaches for
            order, the application should be based on concrete facts such as
            relating to the offence, and why the applicant reasonably apprehends
            arrest, as well as his side of the story, and not vague or general
            allegations, relatable to one or other specific offence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Depending on the seriousness of the threat of arrest the Court
            should issue notice to the public prosecutor and obtain facts, even
            while granting limited interim anticipatory bail.
          </li>
          <li>
            An order of anticipatory bail should not be &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; in
            the sense that it cannot operate in respect of a future incident
            that involves commission of an offence.
          </li>
          <li>
            An order of anticipatory bail does not in any manner limit or
            restrict the rights or duties of the police or investigating agency,
            to investigate into the charges against the person who seeks and is
            granted pre-arrest bail.

          <u>PARA 9</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 9: In [<strong>Case 1],</strong> the Court noticed that firstly,
          it was urged that the State of Uttar Pradesh had no power to enact the
          <strong> [Act 1] </strong>of 1953 as it relates to the subject of
          industries, the control of which by the Union is declared by
          Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest within the
          meaning of Entry 52 of List I. The <strong>[Act 1]</strong> was
          repugnant to Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and the Industries
          Development Regulation Act, 1951. The Act of 1953 infringes the
          fundamental right carved out under Article 14 as vast powers were
          given to the Cane Commissioner, which could be used in a
          discriminatory manner. The notification dated 27.9.1954 violated the
          fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c). The cane growers
          were compelled to become a member of the society before they could
          sell sugarcane to a factory. The <strong>[Act 1]</strong> and the
          notifications infringe the fundamental right guaranteed by Article
          19(1)(f) and (g) and Article 31 of the Constitution. whether Section
          16 of <strong>[Act 1] </strong>or the said provision of{" "}
          <strong>[Act 1]</strong> is repugnant to Section 3(2)(c) of the
          Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Clause 3 of the Sugarcane
          (Control) Order, 1966 [hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;1966
          Order&rdquo;]? And if so, the provisions of the Central enactments
          will prevail over the provisions of the State enactment and the State
          enactment to that extent would be void under Article 254 of the
          Constitution of India. It is to be noted that in [
          <strong>Case 2</strong>], this Court did not comment on whether a
          power which the State Government exercised under Section 16 of{" "}
          <strong>[Act 1] </strong>would be repugnant to the Central
          legislation, since this Court found no such power exercised by the
          State Government.

          where an additional tax on supply of goods not exceeding one per cent
          was contemplated, which did not find place in Constitution Amendment)

        </p>
        <p>
          He submits that the additional tax, by the Constitution (One Hundred
          and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 was not allowed to find place
          in Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, it is to
          be accepted that Constitution Amendment did not contemplate levy of
          additional tax on services and goods tax. The above submission in so
          far as not continuing an additional tax on supply of goods in the
          Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act is concerned, the
          submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is correct that
          additional tax, which was contemplated by Clause 18 of the Bill did
          not find place in Constitution Amendment Act. Further, Clause 19 of
          the Bill find place as Section 18 of the Constitution (One Hundred and
          First Amendment) Act, 2016. Parliament to make States for loss Thus,
          power of law providing for compensation to the of revenue was
          expressly included by constitutional provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the Preamble of Compensation to States Act, 2017 expressly
          mentions the Act to provide for compensation to the States for the
          loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the goods and
          services Tax in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution (One
          Hundred and First Amendment) Act, Act, 2016. Thus, the Compensation to
          has been enacted under the express We, States Act, 2017 Constitution
          (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016. We thus, also do not find
          any force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner
          that Compensation to States Act, 2017 transgresses the Constitution
          (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016.

          <u>PARA 11:</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Para 11: Given the fact that Triple Talaq is instant and irrevocable,
          it is obvious that any attempt at reconciliation between the husband
          and wife by two arbiters from their families, which is essential to
          save the marital tie, cannot ever take place. Also, as understood by
          the Privy Council in <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, such Triple Talaq is
          valid even if it is not for any reasonable cause, which view of the
          law no longer holds good after <strong>[Case 2]</strong>. This being
          the case, it is clear that this form of Talaq is manifestly arbitrary
          in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and
          whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so
          as to save it. This form of Talaq must, therefore, be held to be
          violative of the fundamental right contained under Article 14 of the
          Constitution of India. In our opinion, therefore,{" "}
          <strong>[Act 1]</strong>, insofar as it seeks to recognize and enforce
          Triple Talaq, is within the meaning of the expression &ldquo;laws in
          force&rdquo; in Article 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to
          the extent that it recognizes and enforces Triple Talaq. Since we have
          declared Section 2 of the&nbsp; <strong>[Act 1]</strong> to be void to
          the extent indicated above on the narrower ground of it being
          manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of
          discrimination in these cases, as was argued by the learned Attorney
          General and those supporting him.

          <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A doctrine that grants the inherent power and authority of the state
            to protect persons who are legally unable to act on their own
            behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine means that when some particular provision of a statute
            offends or is against a constitutional limitation, but that
            provision is severable from the rest of the statute, only that
            offending provision will be declared void by the Court and not the
            entire statute.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine envisages that a public authority ought to maintain a
            sense of proportion between his particular goals and the means he
            employs to achieve those goals, so that his action impinges on the
            individual rights to the minimum extent to preserve the public
            interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            The doctrine which guarantees equal protection of the law and
            prohibits class legislation but permits reasonable classification of
            persons or things.
          </li>

        </p>
        <p>
          Para 12: A true historical investigation would take account of press
          agitation, party conferences, government pronouncements, and debates
          in Parliament. Until comparatively recently, all of these were ignored
          as the result of a rule excluding evidence of the political history of
          a statute. The exclusionary rule was justified by the burden that
          would otherwise be placed upon legal advisers (and the resulting costs
          to their clients) and the uncertainty that would be introduced into
          the law if such historical materials had to be consulted in practice,
          therefore, the judge generally gathered the object of a statute merely
          from perusal of its language, in the light of his knowledge of the
          previous law and general knowledge of social conditions. However, in{" "}
          <strong>[Case 1],</strong> it was held that in certain limited
          situations and for certain limited purposes, Hansard (i.e., the
          Parliamentary record) can be consulted for the purposes of
          ascertaining the intention of the legislature. The precise limits are
          which this may be done are somewhat unclear, and remain hotly
          contested. According to Lord Oliver, this is permissible
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Only... where the expression of the legislative intention is
          genuinely ambiguous or obscure or where a literal or prima facie
          construction leads to a manifest absurdity and where the difficulty
          can be resolved by a clear statement to the matter in issue;
        </p>
        <p>
          The conditions for consulting legislative history were summarized such
          as; &ldquo;Legislation is ambiguous or obscure or leads to an
          absurdity, The material relied upon should consist of one or more
          statements by a Minister or other promoter of the Bill together with
          such other Parliamentary material as is necessary to understand such
          statements and their effect; and lastly the statements relied upon
          should be clear.&rdquo;

            Q6: In Hindustan Lever Emplills Company Limited (TOMCO) and
            Hindustan Lever Limited was in dispute. The employees of both
            Hindustan Lever Limited and TOMCO were concerned about the
            amalgamation. One of the grounds of attack against the scheme was
            the absence of approval of the central government as required under
            S.23 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969.
            That, however, was deleted in 1991. The Supreme Court stated that it
            is significant to take into account the mischief that was sought to
            be cured through the amendment of the statute. Accordingly, the
            court held that once the said section has been deleted from the
            statute book, the requirement of prior approval of the Central
            Government cannot be brought back through the backdoor. The Supreme
