        Para 1: It was further submitted that the suit property was not
        coparcenary property when the two Sale Deeds were executed on
        01.09.1999. The property ceased to be coparcenary property after it was
        divided vide the decree dated 04.11.1964. Reliance was placed on the
        decision of this court in <strong>[Case 1]</strong> wherein it was held
        that, some other judgments were cited before us for the proposition in
        that joint family property continues as such with a sole surviving
        coparcener, and if a son is born to such coparcener, continues as such,
        there being no hiatus merely by virtue of the fact that there is a sole
        surviving coparcener. These judgments would take the appellant any
        further in view of the fact that in none of them is there any
        consideration of the effect of Section 4, 8 and 19 of the{" "}
        <strong>[Act 1]</strong>. It was further submitted that the Appellant
        had no locus to file the Civil Suit on the ground that no sale
        consideration was paid by Respondent No.1.

        <u>PARA 2:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 2: It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation is
        to ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting
        the corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate death
        by liquidation. The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which puts the
        corporate debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery legislation
        for creditors. The interests of the corporate debtor have, therefore,
        been bifurcated and separated from that of its promoters/those who are
        in management. Thus, the resolution process is not adversarial to the
        corporate debtor but, in fact, protective of its interests. The
        moratorium imposed by Section 14 is in the interest of the corporate
        debtor itself, thereby preserving the assets of the corporate debtor
        during the resolution process. The timelines within which the resolution
        process is to take place again protects the corporate debtor's assets
        from further dilution, and also protects all its creditors and workers
        by seeing that the resolution process goes through as fast as possible
        so that another management can, through its entrepreneurial skills,
        resuscitate the corporate debtor to achieve all these ends.&rdquo; A
        reading of these paragraphs will show these very objects are sub-served
        by treating allottees as financial creditors. The Code is thus a
        beneficial legislation which can be triggered to put the corporate
        debtor back on its feet in the interest of unsecured creditors like
        allottees, who are vitally interested in the financial health of the
        corporate debtor, so that a replaced management may then carry out the
        real estate project as originally envisaged and deliver the
        flat/apartment as soon as possible and/or pay compensation in the event
        of late delivery, or non-delivery, or refund amounts advanced together
        with interest. Thus, applying the Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017)
        test, it cannot be said that a square peg has been forcibly fixed into a
        round hole so as to render Section 5(8)(f) manifestly arbitrary i.e.
        excessive, disproportionate or without adequate determining principle.
        For the same reason, it cannot be said that Article 19(1)(g) has been
        infracted and not saved by Article 19(6) as the Amendment Act is made in
        public interest, and it cannot be said to be an unreasonable restriction
        on the Petitioner&rsquo;s fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g).
        Also, there is no infraction of Article 300-A as no person is deprived
        of its property without authority of a constitutionally valid law.

        established by law. The obligation to pay compensation, though not

        Para 4: Upon detailed consideration in [<strong>Case 1] </strong>the
        decision to accept the broader interpretation was accepted by 4 of the
        Judges of the Bench including the Chief justice. They concluded that the
        [<strong>Section 1]</strong> must be read to include any appeals by a
        candidate /his agent on the basis of his or the voter&rsquo;s religion,
        caste, class et cetera, or appeals to not vote for another candidate on
        the basis of his religion, caste et cetera as &ldquo;corrupt
        practices&rdquo;. While bench was hearing this matter on&nbsp;January
        30, it was informed that the identical issue was raised in similar [
        <strong>Case 2]</strong> and the apex court&rsquo;s another Constitution
        Bench has referred a larger Bench. On&nbsp;October 25&nbsp;the
        constitution bench of the Supreme Court which was hearing a slew of
        petitions relating to decisions and questions on electoral malpractices
        arising out of its earlier judgments said for now it will not touch on
        its 1995&nbsp;definition of &ldquo;Hindutva&nbsp;is a way of life and
        not a religion&rdquo; and also not ban its use during elections. The
        minority of bench, however, accepted the contention of the appellants
        and were of the view that they should not test the intellect of the
        legislature and continue to have a restrained meaning. When the word
        &ldquo;his&rdquo; was added to the definition in 196l, the then Law
        Minister, who had introduced the bill had stated that the word "his" was
        inserted so as to punish the candidate who would try to spread or
        promote "his" religion. They were strongly of the view that the
        discussions in the parliament and the intent of the legislatures should
        not challenge and it was outside the purview of Judicial review.

        does not support the activities of the vigilantes. Ms. Hemantika Wahi,
        learned Standing Counsel for the State of Gujarat echoing the aforesaid
        submission contends that certain persons who were engaged in this kind
        of activity, especially the incident that has been referred to in the
        writ petition, have been booked for relevant offences and appropriate
        police action is taken against them. Mr. Tapesh Kumar Singh, learned
        counsel for the State of Jharkhand submits that appropriate legal action
        has been taken and the criminal cases have been instituted against the
        persons who have taken law unto their hands. At this juncture, it is
        submitted by Mr. Sanjay R. Hegde, learned senior counsel appearing for
        the petitioner that the Union of India and the State Governments should
        file their respective affidavits. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor
        General and the other learned counsel appearing for the States pray for
        four weeks' time to file counter affidavit. Needless to say, the counter
        affidavit shall also refer to the incidents, if any, referred to in the
        writ petitions. As far as the prayer No.2 is concerned, Mr. Ranjit
        Kumar, learned Solicitor General and the learned counsel appearing for
        the various States shall assist the Court as to how the activities of
        the vigilantes can be absolutely curtailed and suggest ways and methods
        to work out the same."

      <p>
        Para 6: In order to present to this Court a complete picture of the
        impact of the decision in these cases, the status of the cases has been
        depicted as follows: [<strong>Case 1]</strong> involves seventeen
        officers. From the 2002-03 batch ( <strong>[</strong>
        <strong>Case 2]</strong> ) there are seven officers before this Court
        who have secured protection against release. Altogether before this
        Court, there are twenty-one serving officers including ten retired
        officers (including a few men) who are seeking relief; Of the serving
        officers in [<strong>Case 1]</strong> most have rendered services in
        excess of twenty years. Officers in <strong>[Case 2] </strong>rendered
        continuous service of eighteen years till date; and about thirty
        officers are involved in pending litigation before the AFT from batches
        subsequent to the officers in <strong>[Case 2]</strong>. Of them, a few
        officers are moving the courts agitating their grievance in regard to
        the non-consideration of their entitlement for the grant of PCs. In
        these circumstances, it has been submitted that the Court may consider
        the issuance of directions <em>pari</em>
        <em> materia </em>to those which were issued by this Court in
        sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of paragraph 69 in{" "}
        <strong>[Case 3]. </strong>This, it has been urged, would be appropriate
        since the same policy letter dated 26 September 2008 was the subject
        matter of the judgment of this Court in <strong>[Case 3]</strong>.

          A Writ can be issued by the superior court. Whenever an inferior
          oversteps its jurisdiction or abuses the jurisdiction provided to it
          or when there is an absence of jurisdiction of the inferior court, the
          Writ will be issued to quash the order made by the inferior court.
        </li>
        <li>
          This Writ is not issued often and is an extraordinary remedy which a
          Superior Court issues to an inferior court or tribunal for stopping
          them from deciding a case because these courts do not have the
          jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          This Writ is very important for the personal liberty of the citizens
          because if this Writ is not provided by the Constitution a person can
          be unlawfully restrained or detained by any authority and it will be a
          clear violation of the personal liberty of the citizens.
        </li>
        <li>
          The superior courts order the Inferior Courts to do an act or to
          abstain from doing an act. This order can also be given to an Inferior
          Tribunal, Board, Corporation or any other type of administrative

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Para 7: In <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, this Court in a decision of nine
        judges held that the ability to make decisions on matters close to
        one&rsquo;s life is an inviolable aspect of the human personality:{" "}
        <em>
          &ldquo;The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions
          on vital matters of concern to life&hellip; The intersection between
          one&rsquo;s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to
          freedom of thought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the
          freedom of self-determination&hellip; The family, marriage,
          procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of
          the individual.&rdquo;{" "}
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Constitution Bench of this Court, in <strong>[Case 2] ,</strong> held
        <em>
          : &ldquo;Our autonomy as persons is founded on the ability to decide:
          on what to wear and how to dress, on what to eat and on the food that
          we share, on when to speak and what we speak, on the right to believe
          or not to believe, on whom to love and whom to partner, and to freely
          decide on innumerable matters of consequence and detail to our daily
          lives.&rdquo;
        </em>{" "}
        The strength of the Constitution, therefore, lies in the guarantee which
        it affords that each individual will have a protected entitlement in
        determining a choice of partner to share intimacies within or outside
        marriage. The High Court, in the present case, has treaded on an area
        which must be out of bounds for a constitutional court. The views of the
        High Court have encroached into a private space reserved for women and
        men in which neither law nor the judges can intrude. The High Court was
        of the view that at twenty-four, Hadiya &ldquo;is weak and vulnerable,
        capable of being exploited in many ways&rdquo;. The High Court has lost
        sight of the fact that she is a major, capable of taking her own
        decisions and is entitled to the right recognized by the Constitution to
        lead her life exactly as she pleases. The concern of this Court in
        intervening in this matter is as much about the miscarriage of justice
        that has resulted in the High Court as much as about the paternalism
        which underlies the approach to constitutional interpretation reflected
        in the judgment in appeal.

        <u>PARA 8:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 8: This Court discussed the concept of socially and educationally
        backward classes in <strong>[Case 1];</strong> however, the Court
        observed in paragraph 781 extracted above that Scheduled Castes and
        Scheduled Tribes are admittedly included within the backward classes, as
        such there was no need to discuss that. Thus, the discussion was
        confined to whether&nbsp;&nbsp; socially&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
        educationally&nbsp;&nbsp; backward&nbsp;&nbsp; classes&nbsp;&nbsp;
        can&nbsp;&nbsp; be included in Article 16(4), it was opined that ken of
        Article 16(4) is wider than Article 15(4). It was also observed that
        backward classes contemplated&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Article&nbsp;&nbsp; 16(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; do&nbsp;&nbsp;
        comprise&nbsp;&nbsp; some&nbsp;&nbsp; castes. The Scheduled Castes
        include quite a few castes. Based on the aforesaid
        foundational&nbsp;&nbsp; basis, interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;
        was&nbsp;&nbsp; made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; our
        opinion, the decision is relevant for interpreting Article 16(4)
        provisions in their application&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp; Castes, Scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp; Tribes,
        and&nbsp;&nbsp; other backward classes. They stand on the similar
        footing, and they cannot be treated as different from other as also
        fortified by insertion of Article&nbsp;&nbsp; 342A&nbsp;&nbsp;
        which&nbsp;&nbsp; is pari&nbsp;&nbsp; materia to&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Article&nbsp;&nbsp; 341&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; 342&nbsp;&nbsp; and
        considering&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; definition&nbsp;&nbsp;
        in&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;&nbsp; 366(24)&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (26C) and classification of backward classes can be done. The Scheduled
        Castes and&nbsp;&nbsp; Scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp; Tribes&nbsp;&nbsp;
        admittedly&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; backward, and&nbsp;&nbsp;
        the&nbsp;&nbsp; same yardstick would apply to all. In{" "}
        <strong>[Case 1],</strong> it was held that it is
        permissible&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; make&nbsp;&nbsp;
        sub&shy;classification&nbsp;&nbsp; within&nbsp;&nbsp;
        socially&nbsp;&nbsp; and educationally backward classes. That discussion
        would be applicable for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as they
        admittedly fall under Article 16(4). In <strong>[Case 1]</strong>, B.P.
        Jeevan Reddy, J. observed that several castes or tribes within the
        Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not similarly situated. In{" "}
        <strong>[Case 2],</strong> it was held that Scheduled Castes are group
        of castes, races, tribes, communities, or parts thereof found suitable
        by the commission and notified by the President. Caste is nothing but a
        social class or socially homogenous class. It is based on&nbsp;&nbsp;
        occupational&nbsp;&nbsp; grouping.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Its&nbsp;&nbsp; membership&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp;
        birth, and&nbsp;&nbsp; they inherit the same occupation.

        <u>PARA 9:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 9: Referring to the judgment of this [<strong>Case 1]</strong> in
        the case of Preeti Srivastava (supra), the Constitution Bench did not
        find any ground for holding that the said judgment excluded the role of
        States altogether from admissions. Now, turning to the context in which
        we are adjudicating the present set of proceedings, we have to ascertain
        as to whether setting apart specified percentage of seats for in-service
        doctors in postgraduate medical degree courses is preferable to matters
        of admissions or standards of education. It has been acknowledged in the
        decision of [<strong>Case 2]</strong> that there may be certain
        overlapping of subjects vis-&agrave;-vis Entry 66, Union List and Entry
        25, concurrent List to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
        India. In our opinion, the question of providing a separate entry-path
        to in-service doctors may have some effect on overall standard of
        medical education at the postgraduate degree level institutions, as the
        students who would gain admission to such courses may not come purely on
        the basis of a uniform order of merit. But that is not the manner in
        which we ought to interpret the expression &ldquo;standards&rdquo; in
        institutions of higher education. The Constitution Bench judgment in the
        [<strong>Case 2] </strong>has construed the words &ldquo;coordination
        and determination of standards&rdquo; to mean laying down the standards
        of education. Analysis of<strong> [Act]</strong> reveals that the said
        clause provides a minimum entry standard in the form of clearance of the
        NEET on obtaining minimum of marks of 50 per cent by general category
        candidates. Once these standards are laid down, we are of the view that
        if the State authorities provide an independent channel of entry for
        in-service doctors in postgraduate medical degree courses, who fulfil
        the aforesaid minimum standards, as the latter expression has been
        construed in the case of [<strong>Case 2],</strong> provisions to that
        effect would not be in breach of the constitutional scheme. The impact
        on the &ldquo;standards&rdquo;, as the expression is to be construed in
        Entry 66 of the Union list, would be far too distant from admission
        norms framed by the State authorities for such in-service doctors. The
        separate entry-channel for in- service doctors would be integral to the
        admission norms, relatable to the Entry 25 of the Concurrent List. Such
        admission norms if compatible with minimum standards laid down by the
        MCI, would fall under the items specified against the aforesaid entry of
        List III. The question that arises next is whether Clause of{" "}
        <strong>[Act]</strong> lay down the procedure for admission in such a
        manner that providing a separate entry channel for in- service doctors
        even through the State merit list by an independent statutory instrument
        would be contrary to the provisions of the <strong>(Act</strong>) or
        not. If that is the case, then the respective State legislations and
        Regulations would fall foul of Article (X) and Article (Y) of the
        Constitution of India.

        Para 10: Again in<strong> [ Case 1] </strong>it has been ruled that a
        person making libellous statements in his complaint filed in Court is
        not absolutely protected in a criminal proceeding for defamation, for
        under the Eighth Exception and the illustration to Section 499 the
        statements are privileged only when they are made in good faith. There
        is, therefore, authority for the proposition that in determining the
        criminality of an act under the Indian Penal Code the Courts will not
        extend the scope of special exceptions by resorting to the rule peculiar
        to English common law that the husband and wife are regarded as one. In{" "}
        <strong>[ Case 2 ]</strong> this Court has opined that the Eighth
        Exception to Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code indicates that
        accusation in good faith against the person to any of those who have
        lawful authority over that person is not defamation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>[Case 3]</strong> it has been observed that Exception 8 to
        Section 499 IPC clearly indicates that it is not a defamation to prefer
        in good faith an accusation against any person to any of those who have
        lawful authority over that person with regard to the subject-matter of
        accusation. In the said case the report of the Treasury Officer clearly
        indicated that pursuant to the report made by the accused persons
        against the complainant, a departmental enquiry had been initiated and
        the complainant was found to be guilty. Under such circumstances the
        fact that the accused persons had made a report to the superior officer
        of the complainant alleging that he had abused the Treasury Officer in a
        drunken state which was the gravamen of the complaint, would be covered
        by Exception 8 Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code.

        <u>PARA 11:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 11:The ascertainment of the nature of legal possession is, in fact,
        indispensable in every department of law. It is as essential to the
        determination of international controversies arising out of the
        settlement of new countries, or to the conviction of a prisoner for
        larceny, as it is to the selection of the plaintiff in an action of
        trover or trespass.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>[Case]</strong>, it was held that a beneficiary who murders
        the testator was denied a right to the property bequeathed to him,
        holding that "no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or
        to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own
        iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime." The Court of Appeals
        made the well-known statement, which is particularly applicable here:
        "It is a familiar canon of construction that a thing which is within the
        intention of the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as if
        it were within the letter; and a thing which is within the letter of the
        statute is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of
        the makers. They also said that one who murdered his ancestor in order
        to come into possession of his property should not be permitted to take
        the property.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <strong>[Section]</strong>, whenever a person who is in
        possession of a thing is sued or alleged of not being the owner of that
        thing, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is upon the person
        who files the suit or makes such an allegation or assertion in the first
        place. Possession is also said to be one of the essential requirements
        for the acquisition of ownership. Moreover, one of the most common
        methods of transferring ownership is by transfer of possession.

        <u>PARA 12:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Para 12: Another aspect needs to be addressed. The question we intend to
        pose is whether adultery should be treated as a criminal offence. Even
        assuming that the new definition of&nbsp;adultery encapsules within its
        scope sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman or a widow, adultery is
        basically associated with the institution of marriage. There is no
        denial of the fact that marriage is treated as a social institution and
        regard being had to various aspects that social history has witnessed in
        this country, the Parliament has always made efforts to maintain the
        rights of women. For instance,&nbsp;<strong>[Section 1]</strong>
        &nbsp;IPC deals with husband or relative of husband of a woman
        subjecting her to cruelty. The Parliament has also brought in the
        Protection of Women from&nbsp;Domestic Violence Act, 2005. This
        enactment protects women. It also enters into the matrimonial sphere.
        The offences under the provisions of the said enactment are different
        from the provision that has been conceived of under&nbsp;
        <strong>[Section 2]</strong>&nbsp;IPC or, for that matter, concerning
        bringing of adultery within the net of a criminal offence. There can be
        no shadow of doubt that adultery can be a ground for any kind of civil
        wrong including dissolution of marriage. But the pivotal question is
        whether it should be treated as a criminal offence. When we say so, it
        is not to be understood that there can be any kind of social licence
        that destroys the matrimonial home. It is an ideal condition when the
        wife and husband maintain their loyalty. We are not&nbsp;commenting on
        any kind of ideal situation but, in fact, focusing on whether the act of
        adultery should be treated as a criminal offence. In this context, we
        are reminded of what Edmund Burke, a famous thinker, had said, ―a good
        legislation should be fit and equitable so that it can have a right to
        command obedience‖. Burke would like to put it in two compartments,
        namely, ‗equity &lsquo;and ‗utility &lsquo;. If the principle of Burke
        is properly understood, it conveys those laws and legislations are
        necessary to serve and promote a good life.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Sec 497 IPC and Sec 198 CrPC by its very nature is arbitrary and
          violates Art 14 of the constitution as it deprives women of the right
          to prosecute an adulterous husband. It offends the requirement of
          equal treatment and discriminates on the basis of marital status.
        </li>
        <li>
          Section 497 criminalizes adultery based on a classification made on
          sex alone, such a classification bears no rational nexus with the
          object sought to be achieved and is hence discriminatory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Section 497 is a penal provision for the offence of adultery, an act
          which is committed consensually between two adults who have strayed
          out of the marital bond. Such a provision cannot be considered to be a
          beneficial legislation covered by Article 12 of the Constitution.

        <li>
          Art 15(3) cannot operate as a cover for exemption from an offence
          having penal consequences as a section which perpetuates oppression of
          women is unsustainable in law, and cannot take cover under the guise
          of protective discrimination.
